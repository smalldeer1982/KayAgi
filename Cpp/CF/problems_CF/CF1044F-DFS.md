# DFS

## 题目描述

Let $ T $ be a tree on $ n $ vertices. Consider a graph $ G_0 $ , initially equal to $ T $ . You are given a sequence of $ q $ updates, where the $ i $ -th update is given as a pair of two distinct integers $ u_i $ and $ v_i $ .

For every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ q $ , we define the graph $ G_i $ as follows:

- If $ G_{i-1} $ contains an edge $ \{u_i, v_i\} $ , then remove this edge to form $ G_i $ .
- Otherwise, add this edge to $ G_{i-1} $ to form $ G_i $ .

Formally, $ G_i := G_{i-1} \triangle \{\{u_i, v_i\}\} $ where $ \triangle $ denotes the set [symmetric difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference).

Furthermore, it is guaranteed that $ T $ is always a subgraph of $ G_i $ . In other words, an update never removes an edge of $ T $ .

Consider a connected graph $ H $ and run a depth-first search on it. One can see that the tree edges (i.e. the edges leading to a not yet visited vertex at the time of traversal) form a spanning tree of the graph $ H $ . This spanning tree is not generally fixed for a particular graph — it depends on the starting vertex, and on the order in which the neighbors of each vertex are traversed.

We call vertex $ w $ good if one can order the neighbors of each vertex in such a way that the depth-first search started from $ w $ produces $ T $ as the spanning tree. For every $ i $ from $ 1 $ to $ q $ , find and report the number of good vertices.

## 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 3 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5 $ , $ 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of nodes and the number of updates, respectively.

Each of the next $ n-1 $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \le u, v \le n $ , $ u \ne v $ ) — vertices connected by an edge in $ T $ . It is guaranteed that this graph is a tree.

Each of the next $ q $ lines contains two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \le u, v \le n $ , $ u \ne v $ ) — the endpoints of the edge that is added or removed. It is guaranteed that this edge does not belong to $ T $ .

## 输出格式

For each update, print one integer $ k $ — the number of good vertices $ w $ after the corresponding update.

## 说明/提示

The first sample is depicted in the following figure.

- Let the starting vertex be $ 1 $ . We have two choices of ordering the neighbors of $ 1 $ , either $ [2, 3] $ or $ [3, 2] $ . 
  - If we choose the former, then we reach vertex $ 2 $ . Regardless of the ordering of its neighbors, the next visited vertex will be $ 3 $ . Thus, the spanning tree generated by this DFS will contain edges $ \{1, 2\} $ and $ \{2, 3\} $ , which does not equal to $ T $ .
  - If we choose the latter, we obtain a spanning tree with edges $ \{1, 3\} $ and $ \{2, 3\} $ .
  
   Hence, there is no way of ordering the neighbors of vertices such that the DFS produces $ T $ , and subsequently $ 1 $ is not a good vertex.
- Let the starting vertex be $ 2 $ . We have two choices of traversing its neighbors. If we visit $ 3 $ first, then the spanning tree will consist of edges $ \{2,3\} $ and $ \{1,3\} $ , which is not equal to $ T $ . If we, however, visit $ 1 $ first, then we can only continue to $ 3 $ from here, and the spanning tree will consist of edges $ \{1, 2\} $ and $ \{1,3\} $ , which equals to $ T $ . Hence, $ 2 $ is a good vertex.
- The case when we start in the vertex $ 3 $ is symmetrical to starting in $ 2 $ , and hence $ 3 $ is a good vertex.

 Therefore, the answer is $ 2 $ .After the second update, the edge between $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ is removed, and $ G = T $ . It follows that the spanning tree generated by DFS will be always equal to $ T $ independent of the choice of the starting vertex. Thus, the answer is $ 3 $ .

In the second sample, the set of good vertices after the corresponding query is:

- $ \{2, 3, 5\} $
- $ \{3, 5\} $
- $ \{3, 4, 5\} $
- $ \{4, 5\} $
- $ \{4, 5, 6\} $
- $ \{5, 6\} $

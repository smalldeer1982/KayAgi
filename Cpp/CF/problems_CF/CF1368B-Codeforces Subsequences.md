# Codeforces Subsequences

## 题目描述

Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least $ k $ subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.

Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string $ s $ is a subset of ten characters of $ s $ that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times:  codeforcesisawesome,  codeforcesisawesome,  codeforcesisawesome,  codeforcesisawesome.

Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least $ k $ codeforces subsequences.

## 输入格式

The only line contains a single integer $ k $ ( $ 1 \leq k \leq 10^{16}) $ .

## 输出格式

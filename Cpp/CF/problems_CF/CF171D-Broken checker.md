# Broken checker

## 题目描述

"This problem is rubbish! There is not statement, and there are only 5 test cases. The problemsetter took liberties with this problem!" — people complained in the comments to one round on Codeforces. And even more... No, wait, the checker for the problem was alright, that's a mercy.

## 输入格式

The only line of the input contains an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive. All tests for this problem are different. The contents of the test case doesn't need to be equal to its index.

## 输出格式

The only line of the output contains an integer between 1 and 3, inclusive.

## 说明/提示

This problem has no samples, since there so few test cases.

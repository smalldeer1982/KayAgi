# Codeforces Checking

## 题目描述

Given a lowercase Latin character (letter), check if it appears in the string $ \texttt{codeforces} $ .

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 26 $ ) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a character $ c $ — a single lowercase Latin character (letter).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if $ c $ satisfies the condition, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

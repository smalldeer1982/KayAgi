# Love Story

## 题目描述

Timur loves codeforces. That's why he has a string $ s $ having length $ 10 $ made containing only lowercase Latin letters. Timur wants to know how many indices string $ s $ differs from the string "codeforces".

For example string $ s = $ "coolforsez" differs from "codeforces" in $ 4 $ indices, shown in bold.

Help Timur by finding the number of indices where string $ s $ differs from "codeforces".

Note that you can't reorder the characters in the string $ s $ .

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 1000 $ ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case is one line and contains the string $ s $ , consisting of exactly $ 10 $ lowercase Latin characters.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of indices where string $ s $ differs.

# Partitioning the Array

## 题目描述

Allen has an array $ a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n $ . For every positive integer $ k $ that is a divisor of $ n $ , Allen does the following:

- He partitions the array into $ \frac{n}{k} $ disjoint subarrays of length $ k $ . In other words, he partitions the array into the following subarrays: $ $$$[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k],[a_{k+1}, a_{k+2},\ldots,a_{2k}],\ldots,[a_{n-k+1},a_{n-k+2},\ldots,a_{n}] $ $  </li><li> Allen earns one point if there exists some positive integer  $ m $  ( $ m \\geq 2 $ ) such that if he replaces every element in the array with its remainder when divided by  $ m$$$, then all subarrays will be identical.

Help Allen find the number of points he will earn.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 2\cdot10^5 $ ) — the length of the array $ a $ .

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq n $ ) — the elements of the array $ a $ .

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of points Allen will earn.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, $ k=2 $ earns a point since Allen can pick $ m = 2 $ and both subarrays will be equal to $ [1, 0] $ . $ k=4 $ also earns a point, since no matter what $ m $ Allen chooses, there will be only one subarray and thus all subarrays are equal.

In the second test case, Allen earns $ 1 $ point for $ k=3 $ , where his choice for $ m $ does not matter.

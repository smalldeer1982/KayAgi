# Fixing a Binary String

## 题目描述

You are given a binary string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of zeros and ones. You can perform the following operation exactly once:

1. Choose an integer $ p $ ( $ 1 \le p \le n $ ).
2. Reverse the substring $ s_1 s_2 \ldots s_p $ . After this step, the string $ s_1 s_2 \ldots s_n $ will become $ s_p s_{p-1} \ldots s_1 s_{p+1} s_{p+2} \ldots s_n $ .
3. Then, perform a cyclic shift of the string $ s $ to the left $ p $ times. After this step, the initial string $ s_1s_2 \ldots s_n $ will become $ s_{p+1}s_{p+2} \ldots s_n s_p s_{p-1} \ldots s_1 $ .

For example, if you apply the operation to the string 110001100110 with $ p=3 $ , after the second step, the string will become 011001100110, and after the third step, it will become 001100110011.

A string $ s $ is called  $ k $ -proper if two conditions are met:

- $ s_1=s_2=\ldots=s_k $ ;
- $ s_{i+k} \neq s_i $ for any $ i $ ( $ 1 \le i \le n - k $ ).

For example, with $ k=3 $ , the strings 000, 111000111, and 111000 are $ k $ -proper, while the strings 000000, 001100, and 1110000 are not.

You are given an integer $ k $ , which is a divisor of $ n $ . Find an integer $ p $ ( $ 1 \le p \le n $ ) such that after performing the operation, the string $ s $ becomes $ k $ -proper, or determine that it is impossible. Note that if the string is initially $ k $ -proper, you still need to apply exactly one operation to it.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le k \le n $ , $ 2 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the length of the string $ s $ and the value of $ k $ . It is guaranteed that $ k $ is a divisor of $ n $ .

The second line of each test case contains a binary string $ s $ of length $ n $ , consisting of the characters 0 and 1.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the value of $ p $ to make the string $ k $ -proper, or $ -1 $ if it is impossible.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, if you apply the operation with $ p=3 $ , after the second step of the operation, the string becomes 11100001, and after the third step, it becomes 00001111. This string is $ 4 $ -proper.

In the second test case, it can be shown that there is no operation after which the string becomes $ 2 $ -proper.

In the third test case, if you apply the operation with $ p=7 $ , after the second step of the operation, the string becomes 100011100011, and after the third step, it becomes 000111000111. This string is $ 3 $ -proper.

In the fourth test case, after the operation with any $ p $ , the string becomes $ 5 $ -proper.

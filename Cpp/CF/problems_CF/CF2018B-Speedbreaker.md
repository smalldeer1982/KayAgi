# Speedbreaker

## 题目描述

[Djjaner - Speedbreaker](https://soundcloud.com/luciano-ferrari-151560131/speedbreaker)

⠀



There are $ n $ cities in a row, numbered $ 1, 2, \ldots, n $ left to right.

- At time $ 1 $ , you conquer exactly one city, called the starting city.
- At time $ 2, 3, \ldots, n $ , you can choose a city adjacent to the ones conquered so far and conquer it.

You win if, for each $ i $ , you conquer city $ i $ at a time no later than $ a_i $ . A winning strategy may or may not exist, also depending on the starting city. How many starting cities allow you to win?

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of cities.

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le n $ ) — the deadlines for conquering the cities.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer: the number of starting cities that allow you to win.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, cities $ 2 $ , $ 3 $ , and $ 4 $ are good starting cities.

In the second test case, there are no good starting cities.

In the third test case, the only good starting city is city $ 5 $ .

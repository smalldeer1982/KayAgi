# Add Zeros

## 题目描述

You're given an array $ a $ initially containing $ n $ integers. In one operation, you must do the following:

- Choose a position $ i $ such that $ 1 < i \le |a| $ and $ a_i = |a| + 1 - i $ , where $ |a| $ is the current size of the array.
- Append $ i - 1 $ zeros onto the end of $ a $ .

After performing this operation as many times as you want, what is the maximum possible length of the array $ a $ ?

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 1000 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the length of the array $ a $ .

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le 10^{12} $ ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 3 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible length of $ a $ after performing some sequence of operations.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, we can first choose $ i = 4 $ , since $ a_4 = 5 + 1 - 4 = 2 $ . After this, the array becomes $ [2, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0] $ . We can then choose $ i = 3 $ since $ a_3 = 8 + 1 - 3 = 6 $ . After this, the array becomes $ [2, 4, 6, 2, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] $ , which has a length of $ 10 $ . It can be shown that no sequence of operations will make the final array longer.

In the second test case, we can choose $ i=2 $ , then $ i=3 $ , then $ i=4 $ . The final array will be $ [5, 4, 4, 5, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] $ , with a length of $ 11 $ .

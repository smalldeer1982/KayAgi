# I Love 1543

## 题目描述

One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that $ 1543 $ is the most favorite number in his life.

The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size $ n $ by $ m $ cells; $ n $ and $ m $ are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ .

Polycarp became curious about how many times the number $ 1543 $ would appear in all layers $ ^{\text{∗}} $ of the carpet when traversed clockwise.

 $ ^{\text{∗}} $ The first layer of a carpet of size $ n \times m $ is defined as a closed strip of length $ 2 \cdot (n+m-2) $ and thickness of $ 1 $ element, surrounding its outer part. Each subsequent layer is defined as the first layer of the carpet obtained by removing all previous layers from the original carpet.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $ ) — the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers $ n $ and $ m $ ( $ 2 \leq n, m \leq 10^3 $ , $ n, m $ — even integers).

This is followed by $ n $ lines of length $ m $ , consisting of digits from $ 0 $ to $ 9 $ — the description of the carpet.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n \cdot m $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 10^6 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single number — the total number of times $ 1543 $ appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise.

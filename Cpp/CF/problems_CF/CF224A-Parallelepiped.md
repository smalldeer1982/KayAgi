# Parallelepiped

## 题目描述

You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.

## 输入格式

The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive $ (&gt;0) $ and do not exceed $ 10^{4} $ . It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.

## 输出格式

Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.

## 说明/提示

In the first sample the parallelepiped has sizes $ 1×1×1 $ , in the second one — $ 2×2×3 $ .

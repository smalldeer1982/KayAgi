# Prefix Product Sequence

## 题目描述

Consider a sequence $ \[a_{1},a_{2},... ,a_{n}\] $ . Define its prefix product sequence ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF487C/ff8116fff58c431c0df2f0dc70c6d2a466564b92.png).

Now given $ n $ , find a permutation of $ \[1,2,...,n\] $ , such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of $ \[0,1,...,n-1\] $ .

## 输入格式

The only input line contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ).

## 输出格式

Consider a sequence $ \[a_{1},a_{2},... ,a_{n}\] $ . Define its prefix product sequence ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF487C/ff8116fff58c431c0df2f0dc70c6d2a466564b92.png).

Now given $ n $ , find a permutation of $ \[1,2,...,n\] $ , such that its prefix product sequence is a permutation of $ \[0,1,...,n-1\] $ .

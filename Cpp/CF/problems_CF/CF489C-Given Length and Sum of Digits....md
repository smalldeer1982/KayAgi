# Given Length and Sum of Digits...

## 题目描述

You have a positive integer $ m $ and a non-negative integer $ s $ . Your task is to find the smallest and the largest of the numbers that have length $ m $ and sum of digits $ s $ . The required numbers should be non-negative integers written in the decimal base without leading zeroes.

## 输入格式

The single line of the input contains a pair of integers $ m $ , $ s $ ( $ 1<=m<=100,0<=s<=900 $ ) — the length and the sum of the digits of the required numbers.

## 输出格式

In the output print the pair of the required non-negative integer numbers — first the minimum possible number, then — the maximum possible number. If no numbers satisfying conditions required exist, print the pair of numbers "-1 -1" (without the quotes).

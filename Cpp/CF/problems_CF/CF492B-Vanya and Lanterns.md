# Vanya and Lanterns

## 题目描述

Vanya walks late at night along a straight street of length $ l $ , lit by $ n $ lanterns. Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point $ 0 $ , and its end corresponding to the point $ l $ . Then the $ i $ -th lantern is at the point $ a_{i} $ . The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most $ d $ from it, where $ d $ is some positive number, common for all lanterns.

Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius $ d $ should the lanterns have to light the whole street?

# Treasure

## 题目描述

Malek has recently found a treasure map. While he was looking for a treasure he found a locked door. There was a string $ s $ written on the door consisting of characters '(', ')' and '\#'. Below there was a manual on how to open the door. After spending a long time Malek managed to decode the manual and found out that the goal is to replace each '\#' with one or more ')' characters so that the final string becomes beautiful.

Below there was also written that a string is called beautiful if for each $ i $ ( $ 1<=i<=|s| $ ) there are no more ')' characters than '(' characters among the first $ i $ characters of $ s $ and also the total number of '(' characters is equal to the total number of ')' characters.

Help Malek open the door by telling him for each '\#' character how many ')' characters he must replace it with.

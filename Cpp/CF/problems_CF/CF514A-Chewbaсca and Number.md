# Chewbaсca and Number

## 题目描述

Luke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number $ x $ . Chewbacca isn't good at numbers but he loves inverting digits in them. Inverting digit $ t $ means replacing it with digit $ 9-t $ .

Help Chewbacca to transform the initial number $ x $ to the minimum possible positive number by inverting some (possibly, zero) digits. The decimal representation of the final number shouldn't start with a zero.

## 输入格式

The first line contains a single integer $ x $ $ (1<=x<=10^{18}) $ — the number that Luke Skywalker gave to Chewbacca.

## 输出格式

Print the minimum possible positive number that Chewbacca can obtain after inverting some digits. The number shouldn't contain leading zeroes.

# Kefa and First Steps

## 题目描述

Kefa decided to make some money doing business on the Internet for exactly $ n $ days. He knows that on the $ i $ -th day ( $ 1<=i<=n $ ) he makes $ a_{i} $ money. Kefa loves progress, that's why he wants to know the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment in sequence $ a_{i} $ . Let us remind you that the subsegment of the sequence is its continuous fragment. A subsegment of numbers is called non-decreasing if all numbers in it follow in the non-decreasing order.

Help Kefa cope with this task!

## 输入格式

The first line contains integer $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=10^{5} $ ).

The second line contains $ n $ integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{9} $ ).

## 输出格式

Print a single integer — the length of the maximum non-decreasing subsegment of sequence $ a $ .

## 说明/提示

In the first test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the third to the fifth one.

In the second test the maximum non-decreasing subsegment is the numbers from the first to the third one.

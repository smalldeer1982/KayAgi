# Area of Two Circles' Intersection

## 题目描述

You are given two circles. Find the area of their intersection.

## 输入格式

The first line contains three integers $ x_{1},y_{1},r_{1} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{1},y_{1}<=10^{9},1<=r_{1}<=10^{9} $ ) — the position of the center and the radius of the first circle.

The second line contains three integers $ x_{2},y_{2},r_{2} $ ( $ -10^{9}<=x_{2},y_{2}<=10^{9},1<=r_{2}<=10^{9} $ ) — the position of the center and the radius of the second circle.

## 输出格式

Print the area of the intersection of the circles. The answer will be considered correct if the absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $ 10^{-6} $ .

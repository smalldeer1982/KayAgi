# Grandfather Dovlet’s calculator

## 题目描述

Once Max found an electronic calculator from his grandfather Dovlet's chest. He noticed that the numbers were written with seven-segment indicators ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment\_display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display)).

For example if $ a=1 $ and $ b=3 $ then at first the calculator will print $ 2 $ segments, then — $ 5 $ segments and at last it will print $ 5 $ segments. So the total number of printed segments is $ 12 $ .

## 输入格式

The only line contains two integers $ a,b $ ( $ 1<=a<=b<=10^{6} $ ) — the first and the last number typed by Max.

## 输出格式

Print the only integer $ a $ — the total number of printed segments.

# Marmots (hard)

## 题目描述

Your task is the exact same as for the easy version. But this time, the marmots subtract the village's population $ P $ from their random number before responding to Heidi's request.

Also, there are now villages with as few as a single inhabitant, meaning that ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF802F/461a95b8c5252e089881c1c6c1264eb821fb7241.png).

Can you help Heidi find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution?

## 输入格式

Same as for the easy and medium versions. But remember that now $ 1<=P<=1000 $ and that the marmots may provide positive as well as negative integers.

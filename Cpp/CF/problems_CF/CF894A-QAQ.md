# QAQ

## 题目描述

"QAQ" is a word to denote an expression of crying. Imagine "Q" as eyes with tears and "A" as a mouth.

Now Diamond has given Bort a string consisting of only uppercase English letters of length $ n $ . There is a great number of "QAQ" in the string (Diamond is so cute!).

Note that the letters "QAQ" don't have to be consecutive, but the order of letters should be exact.

## 输入格式

The only line contains a string of length $ n $ ( $ 1<=n<=100 $ ). It's guaranteed that the string only contains uppercase English letters.

## 输出格式

Print a single integer — the number of subsequences "QAQ" in the string.

## 说明/提示

In the first example there are $ 4 $ subsequences "QAQ": "QAQAQYSYIOIWIN", "QAQAQYSYIOIWIN", "QAQAQYSYIOIWIN", "QAQAQYSYIOIWIN".

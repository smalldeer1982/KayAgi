# New Year's Eve

## 题目描述

Since Grisha behaved well last year, at New Year's Eve he was visited by Ded Moroz who brought an enormous bag of gifts with him! The bag contains $ n $ sweet candies from the good ol' bakery, each labeled from $ 1 $ to $ n $ corresponding to its tastiness. No two candies have the same tastiness.

The choice of candies has a direct effect on Grisha's happiness. One can assume that he should take the tastiest ones — but no, the holiday magic turns things upside down. It is the xor-sum of tastinesses that matters, not the ordinary sum!

A xor-sum of a sequence of integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{m} $ is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements: ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912B/475d3a054d8c211f23a68d652dd85385e5ab9fc9.png), here ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF912B/4298d47c0191af3c0a3103f431751061bc7e2362.png) denotes the bitwise XOR operation; more about bitwise XOR can be found [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR)

Ded Moroz warned Grisha he has more houses to visit, so Grisha can take no more than $ k $  candies from the bag. Help Grisha determine the largest xor-sum (largest xor-sum means maximum happiness!) he can obtain.

## 输入格式

The sole string contains two integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=10^{18} $ ).

## 输出格式

Output one number — the largest possible xor-sum.

## 说明/提示

In the first sample case, one optimal answer is $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 4 $ , giving the xor-sum of $ 7 $ .

In the second sample case, one can, for example, take all six candies and obtain the xor-sum of $ 7 $ .

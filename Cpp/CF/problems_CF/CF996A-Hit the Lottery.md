# Hit the Lottery

## 题目描述

Allen has a LOT of money. He has $ n $ dollars in the bank. For security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not disclose the reasons here). The denominations for dollar bills are $ 1 $ , $ 5 $ , $ 10 $ , $ 20 $ , $ 100 $ . What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?

## 输入格式

The first and only line of input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^9 $ ).

## 输出格式

Output the minimum number of bills that Allen could receive.

## 说明/提示

In the first sample case, Allen can withdraw this with a $ 100 $ dollar bill, a $ 20 $ dollar bill, and a $ 5 $ dollar bill. There is no way for Allen to receive $ 125 $ dollars in one or two bills.

In the second sample case, Allen can withdraw two $ 20 $ dollar bills and three $ 1 $ dollar bills.

In the third sample case, Allen can withdraw $ 100000000 $ (ten million!) $ 100 $ dollar bills.

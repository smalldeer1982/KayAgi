# Chess For Three

## 题目描述

Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets $ 2 $ points while the loser gets $ 0 $ , and in case of a draw, both players get $ 1 $ point each. Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were $ p_1 $ , $ p_2 $ and $ p_3 $ . Additionally, it is guaranteed that $ p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 $ holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If there isn't any way to obtain $ p_1 $ , $ p_2 $ and $ p_3 $ as a result of a non-negative number of games between the three players, print $ -1 $ instead.

## 说明/提示

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is $ 1 $ .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third example, so the answer for it is $ -1 $ .

# New Palindrome

## 题目描述

A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, abacaba, aaaa, abba, racecar are palindromes.

You are given a string $ s $ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The string $ s $ is a palindrome.

You have to check whether it is possible to rearrange the letters in it to get another palindrome (not equal to the given string $ s $ ).

## 说明/提示

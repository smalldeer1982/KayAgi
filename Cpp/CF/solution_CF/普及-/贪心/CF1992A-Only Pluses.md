## 题目描述

Kmes has written three integers $ a $ , $ b $ and $ c $ in order to remember that he has to give Noobish\_Monk $ a \times b \times c $ bananas.

Noobish\_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the following at most $ 5 $ times:

- pick one of these integers;
- increase it by $ 1 $ .

For example, if $ a = 2 $ , $ b = 3 $ and $ c = 4 $ , then one can increase $ a $ three times by one and increase $ b $ two times. After that $ a = 5 $ , $ b = 5 $ , $ c = 4 $ . Then the total number of bananas will be $ 5 \times 5 \times 4 = 100 $ .

What is the maximum value of $ a \times b \times c $ Noobish\_Monk can achieve with these operations?

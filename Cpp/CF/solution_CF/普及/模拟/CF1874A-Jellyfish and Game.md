# Jellyfish and Game

## 题目描述

Jellyfish has $ n $ green apples with values $ a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $ and Gellyfish has $ m $ green apples with values $ b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m $ .

They will play a game with $ k $ rounds. For $ i=1,2,\ldots,k $ in this order, they will perform the following actions:

- If $ i $ is odd, Jellyfish can choose to swap one of her apples with one of Gellyfish's apples or do nothing.
- If $ i $ is even, Gellyfish can choose to swap one of his apples with one of Jellyfish's apples or do nothing.

Both players want to maximize the sum of the values of their apples.

Since you are one of the smartest people in the world, Jellyfish wants you to tell her the final sum of the value of her apples after all $ k $ rounds of the game. Assume that both Jellyfish and Gellyfish play optimally to maximize the sum of values of their apples.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, Jellyfish will swap the apple of value $ 1 $ and $ 4 $ .

In the second test case, both players will swap the two apples $ 10,000 $ times.

In the fourth test case, Jellyfish will do nothing.

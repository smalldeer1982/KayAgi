# Asesino (Hard Version)

## 题目描述

This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, you must use the minimum number of queries possible. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.

This is an interactive problem.

It is a tradition in Mexico's national IOI trainings to play the game "Asesino", which is similar to "Among Us" or "Mafia".

Today, $ n $ players, numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ , will play "Asesino" with the following three roles:

- Knight: a Knight is someone who always tells the truth.
- Knave: a Knave is someone who always lies.
- Impostor: an Impostor is someone everybody thinks is a Knight, but is secretly a Knave.

Each player will be assigned a role in the game. There will be exactly one Impostor but there can be any (possible zero) number of Knights and Knaves.

As the game moderator, you have accidentally forgotten the roles of everyone, but you need to determine the player who is the Impostor.

To determine the Impostor, you will ask some questions. In each question, you will pick two players $ i $ and $ j $ ( $ 1 \leq i, j \leq n $ ; $ i \neq j $ ) and ask if player $ i $ thinks that player $ j $ is a Knight. The results of the question is shown in the table below.

 KnightKnaveImpostorKnightYesNoYesKnaveNoYesNoImpostorNoYes— The response of the cell in row $ a $ and column $ b $ is the result of asking a question when $ i $ has role $ a $ and $ j $ has row $ b $ . For example, the "Yes" in the top right cell belongs to row "Knight" and column "Impostor", so it is the response when $ i $ is a Knight and $ j $ is an Impostor.Find the Impostor in the minimum number of queries possible. That is, let $ f(n) $ be the minimum integer such that for $ n $ players, there exists a strategy that can determine the Impostor using at most $ f(n) $ questions. Then, you should use at most $ f(n) $ questions to determine the Impostor.

Note: the grader is adaptive: the roles of the players are not fixed in the beginning and may change depending on your questions. However, it is guaranteed that there exists an assignment of roles that is consistent with all previously asked questions under the constraints of this problem.

## 说明/提示

Note that the example test cases do not represent an optimal strategy for asking questions and are only shown for the sake of demonstrating the interaction format. Specifically, we cannot determine which player is the Impostor from the questions asked in the examples.

In the first test case of the example, players at indices $ 2 $ and $ 6 $ are Knights, players at indices $ 1 $ , $ 3 $ , $ 5 $ , and $ 7 $ are Knaves, and the Impostor is at index $ 4 $ . The following is an explanation of the questions asked:

- In the first query, player $ i $ is a Knave and player $ j $ is a Knave. The answer is "yes" since Knaves always lie.
- In the second query, player $ i $ is a Knave and player $ j $ is a Knight. The answer is "no" since Knaves always lie.
- In the third query, player $ i $ is a Knight and player $ j $ is a Knave. The answer is "no" since Knights always tell the truth.
- In the fourth query, player $ i $ is a Knight and player $ j $ is a Knight. The answer is "yes" since Knights always tell the truth.
- In the fifth query, player $ i $ is a Impostor and player $ j $ is a Knave. The answer is "yes" since the Impostor always lies.
- In the sixth query, player $ i $ is a Impostor and player $ j $ is a Knight. The answer is "no" since the Impostor always lies.
- In the seventh query, player $ i $ is a Knave and player $ j $ is a Impostor. The answer is "no" since Knaves always lie and Knaves thinks that the Impostor is a Knight.

## 综合分析与结论

### 核心思路
通过构建有向图模型，将每次询问视为有向边。当两个节点间的双向边回答不一致时，内鬼必在两者中，否则两者均非内鬼。最终通过分组排除法确定内鬼位置。

### 解决难点
- **自适应交互**：通过环结构询问打破矛盾，确保总能推导出唯一解
- **奇偶处理**：对奇数n采用三元环预判，将问题转化为偶数情况
- **询问次数证明**：利用图论特性（入度/出度）证明下限为n次

### 可视化设计
1. **像素化图模型**：
   - 用不同颜色节点表示普通角色（灰）和候选内鬼（红）
   - 每次询问以闪烁箭头动画呈现，回答Yes为绿箭头，No为红箭头
   - 检测到矛盾边时触发爆炸特效，高亮候选节点

2. **音效系统**：
   - 正确排除区域时播放上升音阶
   - 发现矛盾边时播放金属碰撞声
   - 最终确定内鬼时播放8-bit胜利音效

3. 自动演示模式：
   - 按最优策略自动生成询问序列
   - 用慢速动画展示三元环判断等关键步骤
   - 可随时暂停观察当前图结构

            a ^= qry(n-1,n); 
            b ^= qry(n-2,n-1);
            cout<<"! "<<(a&&b?n-1:(a?n:n-2))<<endl;
            return;
        } else n -= 3; // 转化为偶数问题
    }
    // 处理偶数情况
    for(int i=1; i<n; i+=2) {
        if(qry(i,i+1) ^ qry(i+1,i)) { // 发现矛盾边
            cout<<"! "<<(qry(i,1)^qry(1,i)?i:i+1)<<endl;
            return;
        }
    }
    cout<<"! "<<n<<endl; // 处理最后未配对节点
}

## 个人心得摘录
"被同学质疑一早上后终于确信图模型思路的正确性。关键突破在于将内鬼的伪装特性转化为图结构中的矛盾边，这需要跳出传统逻辑推理的框架进行建模。"

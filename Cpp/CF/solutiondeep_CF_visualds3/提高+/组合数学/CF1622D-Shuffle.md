# Shuffle

## 题目描述

You are given a binary string (i. e. a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1) $ s $ of length $ n $ . You can perform the following operation with the string $ s $ at most once: choose a substring (a contiguous subsequence) of $ s $ having exactly $ k $ characters 1 in it, and shuffle it (reorder the characters in the substring as you wish).

Calculate the number of different strings which can be obtained from $ s $ by performing this operation at most once.

## 说明/提示

Some strings you can obtain in the first example:

- to obtain 0110110, you can take the substring from the $ 1 $ -st character to the $ 4 $ -th character, which is 1100, and reorder its characters to get 0110;
- to obtain 1111000, you can take the substring from the $ 3 $ -rd character to the $ 7 $ -th character, which is 00110, and reorder its characters to get 11000;
- to obtain 1100101, you can take the substring from the $ 5 $ -th character to the $ 7 $ -th character, which is 110, and reorder its characters to get 101.

In the second example, $ k = 0 $ so you can only choose the substrings consisting only of 0 characters. Reordering them doesn't change the string at all, so the only string you can obtain is 10010.

# Nearest Interesting Number

## 题目描述

Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $ 3 $ , then the number itself is divisible by $ 3 $ . He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $ 4 $ , are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $ n $ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $ 4 $ .

Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $ a $ . That is, find the interesting number $ n $ such that $ n \ge a $ and $ n $ is minimal.

## 输入格式

The only line in the input contains an integer $ a $ ( $ 1 \le a \le 1000 $ ).

## 输出格式

Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $ a $ . In other words, print the interesting number $ n $ such that $ n \ge a $ and $ n $ is minimal.

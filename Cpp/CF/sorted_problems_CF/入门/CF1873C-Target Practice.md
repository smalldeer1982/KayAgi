# Target Practice

## 题目描述

A $ 10 \times 10 $ target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.

## 输入格式

The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 1000 $ ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either $ \texttt{X} $ (representing an arrow) or $ \texttt{.} $ (representing no arrow).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of points of the arrows.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is $ 3 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 = 17 $ .

In the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is $ 0 $ .

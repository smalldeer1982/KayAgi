# Two Bags of Potatoes

## 题目描述

Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains $ x $ $ (x>=1) $ potatoes, and the second — $ y $ $ (y>=1) $ potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains $ x $ potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes $ (x+y) $ in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than $ n $ , and, secondly, was divisible by $ k $ .

Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains three integers $ y $ , $ k $ , $ n $ ( $ 1<=y,k,n<=10^{9}; $ ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF239A/53488bbee46df1b241cbadadd932aea80891152b.png) $ <=10^{5} $ ).

## 输出格式

Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of $ x $ in ascending order. You should print each possible value of $ x $ exactly once.

If there are no such values of $ x $ print a single integer -1.

# Beautiful Year

## 题目描述

It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.

## 输入格式

The single line contains integer $ y $ $ (1000<=y<=9000) $ — the year number.

## 输出格式

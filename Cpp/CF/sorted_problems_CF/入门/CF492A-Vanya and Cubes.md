# Vanya and Cubes

## 题目描述

Vanya got $ n $ cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them. Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the pyramid must consist of $ 1 $ cube, the second level must consist of $ 1+2=3 $ cubes, the third level must have $ 1+2+3=6 $ cubes, and so on. Thus, the $ i $ -th level of the pyramid must have $ 1+2+...+(i-1)+i $ cubes.

Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that he can make using the given cubes.

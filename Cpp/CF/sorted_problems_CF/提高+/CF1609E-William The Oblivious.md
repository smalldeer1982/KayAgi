# William The Oblivious

## 题目描述

![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF1609E/0e83a16b376d35306235c93a9bc0616a224b28a1.png)Before becoming a successful trader William got a university degree. During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is a formal description of the homework assignment as William heard it:

You are given a string $ s $ of length $ n $ only consisting of characters "a", "b" and "c". There are $ q $ queries of format ( $ pos, c $ ), meaning replacing the element of string $ s $ at position $ pos $ with character $ c $ . After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string "abc" as a subsequence. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with "a", "b" or "c".

A string $ x $ is said to be a subsequence of string $ y $ if $ x $ can be obtained from $ y $ by deleting some characters without changing the ordering of the remaining characters.

## 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ $ (1 \le n, q \le 10^5) $ , the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains the string $ s $ , consisting of characters "a", "b" and "c".

Each of the next $ q $ lines contains an integer $ i $ and character $ c $ $ (1 \le i \le n) $ , index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $ c $ value is "a", "b" or "c".

## 输出格式

For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain "abc" as a subsequence.

## 说明/提示

Let's consider the state of the string after each query:

1. $ s =  $ "aaaaccccc". In this case the string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence and no replacements are needed.
2. $ s =  $ "aaabccccc". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "aaaaccccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
3. $ s =  $ "ababccccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ aaaaccccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
4. $ s =  $ "ababacccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "aaaaacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
5. $ s =  $ "bbabacccc". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "bbacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
6. $ s =  $ "bbababccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "bbacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
7. $ s =  $ "bbabcbccc". In this case 1 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "bbcbcbccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
8. $ s =  $ "baabcbccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "bbbbcbccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
9. $ s =  $ "aaabcbccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "aaacccccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
10. $ s =  $ "aaababccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "aaacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
11. $ s =  $ "aaababccc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "aaacacccc". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.
12. $ s =  $ "aaababbcc". In this case 2 replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $ s =  $ "aaababbbb". This string does not contain "abc" as a subsequence.

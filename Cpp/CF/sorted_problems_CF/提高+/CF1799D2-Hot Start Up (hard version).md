# Hot Start Up (hard version)

## 题目描述

This is a hard version of the problem. The constraints of $ t $ , $ n $ , $ k $ are the only difference between versions.

You have a device with two CPUs. You also have $ k $ programs, numbered $ 1 $ through $ k $ , that you can run on the CPUs.

The $ i $ -th program ( $ 1 \le i \le k $ ) takes $ cold_i $ seconds to run on some CPU. However, if the last program we ran on this CPU was also program $ i $ , it only takes $ hot_i $ seconds ( $ hot_i \le cold_i $ ). Note that this only applies if we run program $ i $ multiple times consecutively — if we run program $ i $ , then some different program, then program $ i $ again, it will take $ cold_i $ seconds the second time.

You are given a sequence $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ of length $ n $ , consisting of integers from $ 1 $ to $ k $ . You need to use your device to run programs $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ in sequence. For all $ 2 \le i \le n $ , you cannot start running program $ a_i $ until program $ a_{i - 1} $ has completed.

Find the minimum amount of time needed to run all programs $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ in sequence.

## 输入格式

Input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ , the number of test cases ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^5 $ ).

The first line of each test case contains $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1 \le n, k \le 3 \cdot 10^5 $ ).

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ integers $ a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n $ ( $ 1 \le a_i \le k $ ).

The third line of each test case contains $ k $ integers $ cold_1, cold_2, \ldots, cold_k $ ( $ 1 \le cold_i \le 10^9 $ ).

The fourth line of each test case contains $ k $ integers $ hot_1, hot_2, \ldots, hot_k $ ( $ 1 \le hot_i \le cold_i $ ).

It is guaranteed the sum of $ n $ and the sum of $ k $ over all test cases do not exceed $ 3 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, print the minimum time needed to run all programs in the given order.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, we can do the following:

- Run program $ a_1 = 1 $ on CPU $ 1 $ . It takes $ cold_1 = 3 $ seconds to run.
- Run program $ a_2 = 2 $ on CPU $ 2 $ . It takes $ cold_2 = 2 $ seconds to run.
- Run program $ a_3 = 2 $ on CPU $ 2 $ . The last program run on this CPU was also program $ 2 $ , so it takes $ hot_2 = 1 $ second to run.

In total, we need $ 3 + 2 + 1 = 6 $ seconds to run them all. We can show this is optimal.

In the second test case, we can use do the following:

- Run program $ a_1 = 1 $ on CPU $ 1 $ . It takes $ cold_1 = 5 $ seconds to run.
- Run program $ a_2 = 2 $ on CPU $ 2 $ . It takes $ cold_2 = 3 $ seconds to run.
- Run program $ a_3 = 1 $ on CPU $ 1 $ . The last program run on this CPU was also program $ 1 $ , so it takes $ hot_1 = 2 $ seconds to run.
- Run program $ a_4 = 2 $ on CPU $ 2 $ . The last program run on this CPU was also program $ 2 $ , so it takes $ hot_2 = 1 $ second to run.

In total, we need $ 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 11 $ seconds. We can show this is optimal.

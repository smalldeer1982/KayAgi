# Vasiliy's Multiset

## 题目描述

Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.

You are given $ q $ queries and a multiset $ A $ , initially containing only integer $ 0 $ . There are three types of queries:

1. "+ x" — add integer $ x $ to multiset $ A $ .
2. "- x" — erase one occurrence of integer $ x $ from multiset $ A $ . It's guaranteed that at least one $ x $ is present in the multiset $ A $ before this query.
3. "? x" — you are given integer $ x $ and need to compute the value ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/728a3690d3a76b81fb1ccb07b4c04b8d10b1870d.png), i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer $ x $ and some integer $ y $ from the multiset $ A $ .

Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains a single integer $ q $ ( $ 1<=q<=200000 $ ) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.

Each of the following $ q $ lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer $ x_{i} $ ( $ 1<=x_{i}<=10^{9} $ ). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.

Note, that the integer $ 0 $ will always be present in the set $ A $ .

## 输出格式

For each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer $ x_{i} $ and some integer from the multiset $ A $ .

## 说明/提示

After first five operations multiset $ A $ contains integers $ 0 $ , $ 8 $ , $ 9 $ , $ 11 $ , $ 6 $ and $ 1 $ .

The answer for the sixth query is integer ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/4b442d72cf0f109da9eae35430cf9dc9dfa35fdf.png) — maximum among integers ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/c712973b7cb6a6b393c3b423fc78dda636ebb034.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/e9b3f94b7acd1861f4b82fb60d691b2bd163374e.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/1bf5d0b4ff98720973629f7915ae529e790539ba.png), ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/9023c8bab139f08429005ae47d2d497f5795be9b.png) and ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF706D/e21b15be88af70287d01c0b8f13ae0d351197a9c.png).

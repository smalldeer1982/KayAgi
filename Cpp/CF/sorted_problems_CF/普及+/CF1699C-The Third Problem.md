# The Third Problem

## 题目描述

You are given a permutation $ a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n $ of integers from $ 0 $ to $ n - 1 $ . Your task is to find how many permutations $ b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n $ are similar to permutation $ a $ .

Two permutations $ a $ and $ b $ of size $ n $ are considered similar if for all intervals $ [l,r] $ ( $ 1 \le l \le r \le n $ ), the following condition is satisfied: $ $$$\operatorname{MEX}([a_l,a_{l+1},\ldots,a_r])=\operatorname{MEX}([b_l,b_{l+1},\ldots,b_r]), $ $  where the  $ \\operatorname{MEX} $  of a collection of integers  $ c\_1,c\_2,\\ldots,c\_k $  is defined as the smallest non-negative integer  $ x $  which does not occur in collection  $ c $ . For example,  $ \\operatorname{MEX}(\[1,2,3,4,5\])=0 $ , and  $ \\operatorname{MEX}(\[0,1,2,4,5\])=3 $ .</p><p>Since the total number of such permutations can be very large, you will have to print its remainder modulo  $ 10^9+7 $ .</p><p>In this problem, a permutation of size  $ n $  is an array consisting of  $ n $  distinct integers from  $ 0 $  to  $ n-1 $  in arbitrary order. For example,  $ \[1,0,2,4,3\] $  is a permutation, while  $ \[0,1,1\] $  is not, since  $ 1 $  appears twice in the array.  $ \[0,1,3\] $  is also not a permutation, since  $ n=3 $  and there is a  $ 3$$$ in the array.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n \le 10^5 $ ) — the size of permutation $ a $ .

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ distinct integers $ a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n $ ( $ 0 \le a_i \lt n $ ) — the elements of permutation $ a $ .

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ across all test cases does not exceed $ 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, print a single integer, the number of permutations similar to permutation $ a $ , taken modulo $ 10^9+7 $ .

## 说明/提示

For the first test case, the only permutations similar to $ a=[4,0,3,2,1] $ are $ [4,0,3,2,1] $ and $ [4,0,2,3,1] $ .

For the second and third test cases, the given permutations are only similar to themselves.

For the fourth test case, there are $ 4 $ permutations similar to $ a=[1,2,4,0,5,3] $ :

- $ [1,2,4,0,5,3] $ ;
- $ [1,2,5,0,4,3] $ ;
- $ [1,4,2,0,5,3] $ ;
- $ [1,5,2,0,4,3] $ .

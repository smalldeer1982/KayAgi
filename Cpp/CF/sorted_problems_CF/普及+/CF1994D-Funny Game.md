# Funny Game

## 题目描述

Vanya has a graph with $ n $ vertices (numbered from $ 1 $ to $ n $ ) and an array $ a $ of $ n $ integers; initially, there are no edges in the graph. Vanya got bored, and to have fun, he decided to perform $ n - 1 $ operations.

Operation number $ x $ (operations are numbered in order starting from $ 1 $ ) is as follows:

- Choose $ 2 $ different numbers $ 1 \leq u,v \leq n $ , such that $ |a_u - a_v| $ is divisible by $ x $ .
- Add an undirected edge between vertices $ u $ and $ v $ to the graph.

Help Vanya get a connected $ ^{\text{∗}} $ graph using the $ n - 1 $ operations, or determine that it is impossible.

 $ ^{\text{∗}} $ A graph is called connected if it is possible to reach any vertex from any other by moving along the edges.

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^{3} $ ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains the number $ n $ ( $ 1 \leq n \leq 2000 $ ) — the number of vertices in the graph.

The second line of each test case contains $ n $ numbers $ a_1, a_2, \cdots a_n $ ( $ 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 $ ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 2000 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, if there is no solution, then output "No" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "Yes" (without quotes), and then output $ n - 1 $ lines, where in the $ i $ -th line, output the numbers $ u $ and $ v $ that need to be chosen for operation $ i $ .

You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

## 说明/提示

Let's consider the second test case.

- First operation $ (x = 1) $ : we can connect vertices $ 4 $ and $ 1 $ , since $ |a_4 - a_1| = |13 - 99| = |-86| = 86 $ , and $ 86 $ is divisible by $ 1 $ .

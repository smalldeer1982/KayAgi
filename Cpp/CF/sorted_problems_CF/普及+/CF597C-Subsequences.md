# Subsequences

## 题目描述

For the given sequence with $ n $ different elements find the number of increasing subsequences with $ k+1 $ elements. It is guaranteed that the answer is not greater than $ 8·10^{18} $ .

## 输入格式

First line contain two integer values $ n $ and $ k $ $ (1<=n<=10^{5},0<=k<=10) $ — the length of sequence and the number of elements in increasing subsequences.

Next $ n $ lines contains one integer $ a_{i} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=n $ ) each — elements of sequence. All values $ a_{i} $ are different.

## 输出格式

Print one integer — the answer to the problem.

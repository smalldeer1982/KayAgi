# Set

## 题目描述

You are given a positive integer $ k $ and a set $ S $ of all integers from $ l $ to $ r $ (inclusive).

You can perform the following two-step operation any number of times (possibly zero):

1. First, choose a number $ x $ from the set $ S $ , such that there are at least $ k $ multiples of $ x $ in $ S $ (including $ x $ itself);
2. Then, remove $ x $ from $ S $ (note that nothing else is removed).

Find the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1\le t\le 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers $ l $ , $ r $ , and $ k $ ( $ 1\le l\le r\leq 10^9 $ , $ 1\leq k\le r-l+1 $ ) — the minimum integer in $ S $ , the maximum integer in $ S $ , and the parameter $ k $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible number of operations that can be performed.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, initially, $ S = \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9\} $ . One possible optimal sequence of operations is:

1. Choose $ x = 4 $ for the first operation, since there are two multiples of $ 4 $ in $ S $ : $ 4 $ and $ 8 $ . $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{3,5,6,7,8,9\} $ ;
2. Choose $ x = 3 $ for the second operation, since there are three multiples of $ 3 $ in $ S $ : $ 3 $ , $ 6 $ , and $ 9 $ . $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{5,6,7,8,9\} $ .

In the second test case, initially, $ S=\{4,5,6,7,8,9\} $ . One possible optimal sequence of operations is:

1. Choose $ x = 5 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{4,6,7,8,9\} $ ;
2. Choose $ x = 6 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{4,7,8,9\} $ ;
3. Choose $ x = 4 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{7,8,9\} $ ;
4. Choose $ x = 8 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{7,9\} $ ;
5. Choose $ x = 7 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{9\} $ ;
6. Choose $ x = 9 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{\} $ .

In the third test case, initially, $ S=\{7,8,9\} $ . For each $ x $ in $ S $ , no multiple of $ x $ other than $ x $ itself can be found in $ S $ . Since $ k = 2 $ , you can perform no operations.

In the fourth test case, initially, $ S=\{2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\} $ . One possible optimal sequence of operations is:

1. Choose $ x = 2 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\} $ ;
2. Choose $ x = 4 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{3,5,6,7,8,9,10\} $ ;
3. Choose $ x = 3 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{5,6,7,8,9,10\} $ ;
4. Choose $ x = 5 $ , $ S $ becomes equal to $ \{6,7,8,9,10\} $ .

# Again Twenty Five!

## 题目描述

The HR manager was disappointed again. The last applicant failed the interview the same way as 24 previous ones. "Do I give such a hard task?" — the HR manager thought. "Just raise number $ 5 $ to the power of $ n $ and get last two digits of the number. Yes, of course, $ n $ can be rather big, and one cannot find the power using a calculator, but we need people who are able to think, not just follow the instructions."

Could you pass the interview in the machine vision company in IT City?

## 输入格式

The only line of the input contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2<=n<=2·10^{18} $ ) — the power in which you need to raise number $ 5 $ .

## 输出格式

Output the last two digits of $ 5^{n} $ without spaces between them.

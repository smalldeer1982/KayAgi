# Lazy Security Guard

## 题目描述

Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly $ N $ city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly $ N $ blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.

## 输入格式

## 输出格式

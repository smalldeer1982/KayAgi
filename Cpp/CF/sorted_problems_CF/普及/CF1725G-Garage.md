An integer $ x $ is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigning positive integer values for the lengths $ a $ and $ b $ ( $ a<b $ ) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly $ x $ . As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the $ N $ -th smallest suitable number.

## 输入格式

The only line contains a single integer $ N $ ( $ 1 \leq N \leq 10^9 $ ).

## 输出格式

An integer that represents the $ N $ -th smallest suitable number.

## 说明/提示

The $ 3 $ -rd smallest suitable number is $ 7 $ . A square area of $ 7 $ can be obtained by assigning $ a=3 $ and $ b=4 $ .

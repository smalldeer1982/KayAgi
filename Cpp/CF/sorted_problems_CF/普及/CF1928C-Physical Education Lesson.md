# Physical Education Lesson

## 题目描述

In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual, everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first– $ k $ -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first– $ k $ -th" position occurs as follows: the first $ k $ people have numbers $ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k $ , the next $ k - 2 $ people have numbers $ k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 $ , the next $ k $ people have numbers $ 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k $ , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every $ 2k - 2 $ positions. Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number $ k $ described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how many natural numbers $ k $ fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if $ k > 1 $ . In particular, this means that the settling does not exist for $ k = 1 $ .

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 100 $ ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $ n $ and $ x $ ( $ 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 $ ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the settling.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different $ k $ that fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, $ k $ equals $ 2, 3, 5, 6 $ are suitable.

An example of settling for these $ k $ :

  $ k $ / № $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 3 $  $ 4 $  $ 5 $  $ 6 $  $ 7 $  $ 8 $  $ 9 $  $ 10 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 3 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 3 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 3 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 5 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 3 $  $ 4 $  $ 5 $  $ 4 $  $ 3 $  $ 2 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 6 $  $ 1 $  $ 2 $  $ 3 $  $ 4 $  $ 5 $  $ 6 $  $ 5 $  $ 4 $  $ 3 $  $ 2 $  In the second test case, $ k = 2 $ is suitable.

# Intersection

## 题目描述

You are given two set of points. The first set is determined by the equation $ A_{1}x+B_{1}y+C_{1}=0 $ , and the second one is determined by the equation $ A_{2}x+B_{2}y+C_{2}=0 $ .

Write the program which finds the number of points in the intersection of two given sets.

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains three integer numbers $ A_{1},B_{1},C_{1} $ separated by space. The second line contains three integer numbers $ A_{2},B_{2},C_{2} $ separated by space. All the numbers are between -100 and 100, inclusive.

## 输出格式

Print the number of points in the intersection or -1 if there are infinite number of points.

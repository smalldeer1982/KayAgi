# Points

## 题目描述

You are given $ N $ points on a plane. Write a program which will find the sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains one integer number $ N $ ( $ 1<=N<=100000 $ ) — the number of points. Each of the following $ N $ lines contain two integer numbers $ X $ and $ Y $ ( $ -10000<=X,Y<=10000 $ ) — the coordinates of points. Two or more points may coincide.

## 输出格式

The only line of output should contain the required sum of squares of distances between all pairs of points.

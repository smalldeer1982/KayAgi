# Devyatkino

## 题目描述

You are given a positive integer $ n $ . In one operation, you can add to $ n $ any positive integer whose decimal representation contains only the digit $ 9 $ , possibly repeated several times.

What is the minimum number of operations needed to make the number $ n $ contain at least one digit $ 7 $ in its decimal representation?

For example, if $ n = 80 $ , it is sufficient to perform one operation: you can add $ 99 $ to $ n $ , after the operation $ n = 179 $ , which contains the digit $ 7 $ .

## 输入格式

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $ t $ ( $ 1 \le t \le 10^4 $ ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains an integer $ n $ ( $ 10 \leq n \leq 10^9 $ ).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the minimum number of operations required for the number $ n $ to contain the digit $ 7 $ .

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, three operations are sufficient: $ 51 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 78 $ , which contains the digit $ 7 $ . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve the goal in one or two operations.

In the second test case, two operations are sufficient: $ 60 + 9 + 9 = 78 $ .

In the third test case, one operation is sufficient: $ 61 + 9 = 70 $ .

In the fourth test case, $ n $ already contains the digit $ 7 $ , so no operations are required.

In the fifth test case, you can add $ 99 $ to $ n $ to obtain a number containing the digit $ 7 $ .

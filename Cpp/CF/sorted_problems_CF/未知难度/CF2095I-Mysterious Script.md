# Mysterious Script

## 题目描述

An extraterrestrial species has visited the authors of April Fools Day Contest 2025 while they were preparing problems. They call themselves the "Balikons" and expressed interest in chatting with humans. Although they can make sounds that are similar to human speech, they seem to prefer communicating by writing using a variety of media.

# April Fools' Problem (easy)

## 题目描述

The marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC $ ^{2} $ – this one. It involves numbers $ n $ , $ k $ and a sequence of $ n $ positive integers $ a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n} $ . They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.

However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!

## 输入格式

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $ n $ and $ k $ ( $ 1<=k<=n<=2200 $ ). The second line contains $ n $ space-separated integers $ a_{1},...,a_{n} $ ( $ 1<=a_{i}<=10^{4} $ ).

## 输出格式

Output one number.

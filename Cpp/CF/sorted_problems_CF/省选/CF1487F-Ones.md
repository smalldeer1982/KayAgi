# Ones

## 题目描述

You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer $ n $ .

You have to represent $ n $ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits '1'). For example, $ 24 = 11 + 11 + 1 + 1 $ and $ 102 = 111 - 11 + 1 + 1 $ .

Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.

## 输入格式

The single line contains one integer $ n $ ( $ 1 \le n < 10^{50} $ ).

## 输出格式

Print one integer $ x $ — the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of $ n $ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses $ x $ ones in total.

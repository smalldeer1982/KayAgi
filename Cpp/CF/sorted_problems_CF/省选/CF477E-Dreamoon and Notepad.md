# Dreamoon and Notepad

## 题目描述

Dreamoon has just created a document of hard problems using notepad.exe. The document consists of $ n $ lines of text, $ a_{i} $ denotes the length of the $ i $ -th line. He now wants to know what is the fastest way to move the cursor around because the document is really long.

Let $ (r,c) $ be a current cursor position, where $ r $ is row number and $ c $ is position of cursor in the row. We have $ 1<=r<=n $ and $ 0<=c<=a_{r} $ .

We can use following six operations in notepad.exe to move our cursor assuming the current cursor position is at $ (r,c) $ :

1. up key: the new cursor position $ (nr,nc)=(max(r-1,1),min(a_{nr},c)) $
2. down key: the new cursor position $ (nr,nc)=(min(r+1,n),min(a_{nr},c)) $
3. left key: the new cursor position $ (nr,nc)=(r,max(0,c-1)) $
4. right key: the new cursor position $ (nr,nc)=(r,min(a_{nr},c+1)) $
5. HOME key: the new cursor position $ (nr,nc)=(r,0) $
6. END key: the new cursor position $ (nr,nc)=(r,a_{r}) $

You're given the document description ( $ n $ and sequence $ a_{i} $ ) and $ q $ queries from Dreamoon. Each query asks what minimal number of key presses is needed to move the cursor from $ (r_{1},c_{1}) $ to $ (r_{2},c_{2}) $ .

## 输出格式

For each query print the result of the query.

## 说明/提示

In the first sample, the first query can be solved with keys: HOME, right.

The second query can be solved with keys: down, down, down, END, down.

The third query can be solved with keys: down, END, down.

The fourth query can be solved with keys: END, down.

# Line

## 题目描述

A line on the plane is described by an equation $ Ax+By+C=0 $ . You are to find any point on this line, whose coordinates are integer numbers from $ -5·10^{18} $ to $ 5·10^{18} $ inclusive, or to find out that such points do not exist.

## 输入格式

The first line contains three integers $ A $ , $ B $ and $ C $ ( $ -2·10^{9}<=A,B,C<=2·10^{9} $ ) — corresponding coefficients of the line equation. It is guaranteed that $ A^{2}+B^{2}>0 $ .

## 输出格式

If the required point exists, output its coordinates, otherwise output -1.

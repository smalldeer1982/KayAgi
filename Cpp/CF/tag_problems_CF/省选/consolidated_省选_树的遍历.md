# Tree Queries

## 题目描述

Those who don't work don't eat. Get the things you want with your own power. But believe, the earnest and serious people are the ones who have the last laugh... But even then, I won't give you a present.

—Santa, Hayate no Gotoku!



Since Hayate didn't get any Christmas presents from Santa, he is instead left solving a tree query problem.

Hayate has a tree with $ n $ nodes.

Hayate now wants you to answer $ q $ queries. Each query consists of a node $ x $ and $ k $ other additional nodes $ a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k $ . These $ k+1 $ nodes are guaranteed to be all distinct.

For each query, you must find the length of the longest simple path starting at node $ x^\dagger $ after removing nodes $ a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k $ along with all edges connected to at least one of nodes $ a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k $ .

 $ ^\dagger $ A simple path of length $ k $ starting at node $ x $ is a sequence of distinct nodes $ x=u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_k $ such that there exists a edge between nodes $ u_{i-1} $ and $ u_i $ for all $ 1 \leq i \leq k $ .

## 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $ n $ and $ q $ ( $ 1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the number of nodes of the tree and the number of queries.

The following $ n - 1 $ lines contain two integers $ u $ and $ v $ ( $ 1 \le u, v \le n $ , $ u \ne v $ ) — denoting an edge between nodes $ u $ and $ v $ . It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

The following $ q $ lines describe the queries. Each line contains the integers $ x $ , $ k $ and $ a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k $ ( $ 1 \leq x \leq n $ , $ 0 \leq k < n $ , $ 1 \leq a_i \leq n $ ) — the starting node, the number of removed nodes and the removed nodes.

It is guaranteed that for each query, $ x,a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k $ are all distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ k $ over all queries will not exceed $ 2 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each query, output a single integer denoting the answer for that query.

## 说明/提示

In the first example, the tree is as follows:

In the third query, nodes $ 1 $ and $ 6 $ are missing and the tree is shown below. The longest simple path starting from node $ 2 $ is $ 2 \to 5 $ . Thus, the answer is $ 1 $ .

# Iris's Full Binary Tree

## 题目描述

Iris likes full binary trees.

Let's define the depth of a rooted tree as the maximum number of vertices on the simple paths from some vertex to the root. A full binary tree of depth $ d $ is a binary tree of depth $ d $ with exactly $ 2^d - 1 $ vertices.

Iris calls a tree a  $ d $ -binary tree if some vertices and edges can be added to it to make it a full binary tree of depth $ d $ . Note that any vertex can be chosen as the root of a full binary tree.

Since performing operations on large trees is difficult, she defines the binary depth of a tree as the minimum $ d $ satisfying that the tree is $ d $ -binary. Specifically, if there is no integer $ d \ge 1 $ such that the tree is $ d $ -binary, the binary depth of the tree is $ -1 $ .

Iris now has a tree consisting of only vertex $ 1 $ . She wants to add $ n - 1 $ more vertices to form a larger tree. She will add the vertices one by one. When she adds vertex $ i $ ( $ 2 \leq i \leq n $ ), she'll give you an integer $ p_i $ ( $ 1 \leq p_i < i $ ), and add a new edge connecting vertices $ i $ and $ p_i $ .

Iris wants to ask you the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $ i $ vertices for each $ 1 \le i \le n $ . Can you tell her the answer?

## 输入格式

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $ t $ ( $ 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 $ ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $ n $ ( $ 2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5 $ ) — the final size of the tree.

The second line of each test case contains $ n - 1 $ integers $ p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n $ ( $ 1 \leq p_i < i $ ) — descriptions of all edges of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $ n $ over all test cases does not exceed $ 5 \cdot 10^5 $ .

## 输出格式

For each test case output $ n $ integers, $ i $ -th of them representing the binary depth of the tree formed by the first $ i $ vertices.

## 说明/提示

In the first test case, the final tree is shown below:

 ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF2006E/7f900739a2145e9bd80715ede4260b35ba51b9fd.png)- The tree consisting of the vertex $ 1 $ has the binary depth $ 1 $ (the tree itself is a full binary tree of depth $ 1 $ ).
- The tree consisting of the vertices $ 1 $ and $ 2 $ has the binary depth $ 2 $ (we can add the vertex $ 3 $ to make it a full binary tree of depth $ 2 $ ).
- The tree consisting of the vertices $ 1 $ , $ 2 $ and $ 3 $ has the binary depth $ 2 $ (the tree itself is a full binary tree of depth $ 2 $ ).

In the second test case, the formed full binary tree after adding some vertices to the tree consisting of $ n $ vertices is shown below (bolded vertices are added):

 ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF2006E/90faca99e1781d73f69b5b60a32aa2a2da38a68c.png)The depth of the formed full binary tree is $ 4 $ .

In the fifth test case, the final tree is shown below:

 ![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/vjudge_pic/CF2006E/2c0d039efae462812828b42368688f46ffc8b41e.png)It can be proved that Iris can't form any full binary tree by adding vertices and edges, so the binary depth is $ -1 $ .

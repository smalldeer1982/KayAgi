# [GCJ 2011 #3] Mystery Square
## 题目描述

I have written down a large perfect square in binary, and then replaced some of the digits with question marks. Can you figure out what my original number was?
## 输入格式

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow, one per line. Each line contains $S$: a perfect square written in binary, but with some of the digits replaced by question marks.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #$x$: $N$", where $x$ is the case number (starting from 1) and $N$ is a perfect square written in binary, obtained by replacing each '?' character in $S$ with either a '0' character or a '1' character.
## 样例

## 提示

- $1 \leq T \leq 25$.
- $S$ begins with '1'.
- $S$ contains only the characters '0', '1', and '?'.
- In every test case, there is exactly one possible choice for $N$.

**Small dataset (10 Pts, Test set 1 - Visible)**

- $S$ is at most $60$ characters long.
- $S$ contains at most $20$ '?' characters.
- Time limit: ~~30~~ 6 seconds.

**Large dataset (31 Pts, Test set 2 - Hidden)**

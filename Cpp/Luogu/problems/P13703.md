# [NWERC 2023] Date Picker
## 题目描述

The NWERC is coming up and your agenda is filling up with meetings.
One of your teammates wants to plan a meeting, and asks for your input.
However, instead of asking you for your exact agenda, you have to fill out two separate polls:
one for indicating which days you are available, and one for the hours!

Afilled agenda.
:::

As a computer scientist, you plan your meetings only on whole hours and each meeting takes an integer number of hours.
Therefore, your agenda can be modelled as a matrix of $7$ rows (days), and $24$ columns (hours).
Each cell in this matrix is either '$\texttt{.}$' or '$\texttt{x}$',
meaning that hour of that day you are either free or have a meeting, respectively.

You have to pick at least $d$ days in the first poll and $h$ hours in the second poll,
and we assume the meeting will take place on any of your picked hour/day combinations with equal probability.
What is the probability that you can attend the meeting if you fill in the polls optimally?
## 输入格式

The input consists of:
- $7$ lines with $24$ characters, each character being either '$\texttt{.}$' or '$\texttt{x}$', with '$\texttt{.}$' indicating the time slots you are available.
- One line with two integers $d$ and $h$ ($1 \leq d \leq 7$, $1 \leq h \leq 24$), the minimum number of days and hours you have to fill in.

## 输出格式

Output the probability that you are available at the chosen meeting time. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most $10^{-6}$.

# [NWERC 2024] Dutch Democracy
## 题目描述

The process of forming the Dutch government has taken more than half a year for three elections in a row. Perhaps we can streamline the initial stages of coalition building?

The first step after the election results is to find a group of parties (called a *coalition*) with enough seats to have a strict majority.
Your task is to count the number of candidate coalitions that satisfy specific conditions.
A coalition is considered a *candidate coalition* if it meets these two criteria:

**Strict Majority:** The total number of seats held by the coalition must be strictly more than half of the total seats across all parties.


**No Superfluous Parties:** The coalition must be minimal in the sense that removing any one party from the coalition would cause it to lose its strict majority.

# [CERC 2021] Radar
## 题目描述

We are using a special radar to scan an area. The radar accepts a list of distances, e.g. 2, 4, 1, and a list of angles, e.g. $100^\circ$, $270^\circ$, $180^\circ$, $10^\circ$, $300^\circ$, and scans the points across all the given distances and angles. How close to some other points of interest will we be able to scan?
## 输入格式

The first line of the input gives three space-separated integers: $R$, $F$, $N$, representing the number of radii, the number of angles, and the number of points of interest, respectively. Then $R$ lines follow, $i$-th of which contains an integer $r_i$, representing the distance from the radar that will be scanned. Then, $F$ lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers $(f_x)_i$, $(f_y)_i$, that represent Cartesian coordinates of a point, defining the $i$-th angle. Then, $N$ lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers $x_i$, $y_i$, that represent the Cartesian coordinates of the $i$-th point.

The angle, defined by the point $(f_x)_i$, $(f_y)_i$ is the angle from the $x$-axis to the ray from the origin through $(f_x)_i$, $(f_y)_i$.
## 输出格式

Output $N$ lines, $i$-th of which should contain the distance from the point $(x_i, y_i)$ to the closest scanned point. The result will be considered correct if it is within the $10^{-6}$ of absolute or relative precision.

# [NOISG 2025 Prelim] Ducks And Buttons
## 题目描述

**Warning for C++ users: The large size of integers involved in this problem may require the use of the `long long` data type instead of the `int` data type.**

Shor the Duck is playing a game with his friends! The game is played on a 1-dimensional grid consisting of $n$ cells in, arranged in a row and numbered from $1$ to $n$ from left to right.

Each cell has a button. The button on cell $i$ will be permanently pressed if at any point in time there are at least $a[i]$ ducks on that cell. Even if the ducks leave, the button remains pressed. To win the game, all $n$ buttons must be pressed.

Initially, there are $d$ ducks on cell $1$. In one move, a single duck can move one cell left or right.

Determine the minimum total number of moves required to win the game. **It is guaranteed that it is possible to win the game with some number of moves.**
## 输入格式

Your program must read from standard input.

The first line of input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $d$.

The second line of input contains $n$ space-separated integers $a[1], a[2], \ldots, a[n]$.

## 输出格式

Your program must print to standard output.

Output a single integer, the minimum total number of moves required to win the game.

## 提示

### Subtasks

For all test cases, the input will satisfy the following bounds:

- $1 \leq n \leq 200\,000$
- $1 \leq d \leq 10^9$
- $0 \leq a[i] \leq d$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$
- It is possible to win the game with some number of moves.

Your program will be tested on input instances that satisfy the following restrictions:

| Subtask | Marks | Additional Constraints |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $0$ | $0$ | Sample test cases |
| $1$ | $8$ | $n = 2$ |
| $2$ | $5$ | $a[i] = 0$ |
| $3$ | $11$ | $a[i] \leq 1$ |
| $4$ | $6$ | All values of $a[i]$ are equal |
| $5$ | $19$ | $n, d \leq 1000$ |
| $6$ | $12$ | $a[i]$ is non-decreasing |
| $7$ | $16$ | $a[i]$ is non-increasing |
| $8$ | $23$ | No additional constraints |

### Sample Test Case 1 Explanation

### Sample Test Case 2 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $3, 5$, and $8$.

### Sample Test Case 3 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $4, 5, 6, 7$, and $8$.

### Sample Test Case 4 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $5, 6$, and $8$.

### Sample Test Case 5 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $5, 7$, and $8$.

### Sample Test Case 6 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $5$ and $8$.

One possible sequence of moves that minimises the total number of moves is shown above. Each red arrow is a move, and the number above it indicates the order of the moves, with move $1$ coming first.

- Button $1$ is first pressed before any moves occur.
- Button $2$ is first pressed after move $3$.
- Button $3$ is first pressed after move $10$.
- Button $4$ is first pressed after move $11$.
- Button $5$ is first pressed after move $18$.
- Button $6$ is first pressed after move $20$.
- Button $7$ is first pressed after move $21$.
- Button $8$ is first pressed before any moves occur (since $a[8] = 0$).

Since all buttons are pressed by the end of all $21$ moves, $21$ moves is sufficient to win the game. It can be proven that $21$ moves is the minimum total number of moves needed.

### Sample Test Case 7 Explanation

This test case is valid for subtasks $4, 6$, and $8$.

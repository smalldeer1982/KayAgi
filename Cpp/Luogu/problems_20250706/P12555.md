# [UOI 2024] AND Array
## 题目描述

An integer $b$ and an array of non-negative integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ are given. All elements of the array $a$ are less than $2^b$.

Let's define $f(s, p)$ ($1\le s\le n$, $0\le p < b$) as the result of the following pseudocode:

```
res = 0
x = power(2, p)
for i = s to n:
    if ((x AND a[i]) == 0):
        x = (x OR a[i])
        res = res + i
return res
```

Here, ``power(2, p)`` denotes $2^p$, ``AND`` denotes the bitwise $\textit{AND}$ operation, and ``OR`` denotes the bitwise $\textit{OR}$ operation.

The bitwise $\textit{AND}$ of non-negative integers $a$ and $b$ is equal to a non-negative integer, in which the binary representation has a one at a certain position only if both binary representations of $a$ and $b$ have ones at that position. For example, $3_{10}$ AND $5_{10} = 0011_{2}$ AND $0101_{2} = 0001_{2} = 1_{10}$.

The bitwise $\textit{OR}$ of non-negative integers $a$ and $b$ is equal to a non-negative integer, in which the binary representation has a zero at a certain position only if both binary representations of $a$ and $b$ have zeros at that position. For example, $3_{10}$ OR $5_{10} = 0011_{2}$ OR $0101_{2} = 0111_{2} = 7_{10}$.

For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, find

$$f(i,0) + f(i, 1) + \ldots + f(i, b-1)$$
## 输入格式

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $b$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq b \leq 20$) --- the length of array $a$ and the limit on the elements of the array, respectively.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i < 2^b$) --- the elements of array $a$.
## 输出格式

Output $n$ integers --- the required values.

## 提示

In the first example, $f(1,0)=1+2+5=8$, $f(1,1)=1+3+5=9$, $f(1,2)=1+2+3=6$, and the first of the required values is equal to $8+9+6 = 23$.

### Scoring

- ($10$ points): $n \leq 2\,000$;
- ($10$ points): $a_i = 2^k$, where $k$ is an integer;
- ($15$ points): $b \leq 8$;
- ($15$ points): $b \leq 12$;
- ($25$ points): $b \leq 16$;
- ($25$ points): without additional constraints.

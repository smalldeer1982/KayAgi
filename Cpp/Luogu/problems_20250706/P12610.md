The second line contains a positive integer, $E$, representing the number of events that happen over the course of the day. The next $E$ pairs of input lines describe these events. The first line in the pair contains either the $+$ (plus) symbol, indicating that donuts have been baked, or the $-$ (minus) symbol, indicating that donuts have been sold. The second line in the pair contains a positive integer, $Q$, representing the quantity of donuts associated with the event.

For each sale of donuts, the value of $Q$ will be less than or equal to the number of donuts
available at that time.

# [UOI 2020] Chessfield
## 题目描述

Pani Annochka recently got an interview with an IT company. In this interview, she was given a *very interesting task*:

The girl is given a field divided into squares. That is, each side is $1$. And each square is painted in either white or black.

We say that a chessfield has sizes $n$ and $m$, when it consists of rectangles having $n$ units in height and $m$ units in width. Also, all these rectangles should be painted either white or black. And each white rectangle borders only on black and vice versa --- each black borders only on white.

For example, the following chessboard has sizes $2$ and $3$ (blue is the coordinate axis):

But these are not:

As you may have noticed, there are often a lot of chessfiels with sizes $n$ and $m$. The challenge is to say how many there are. *No-no-no, it's too easy*.

Annochka also knows $k$ squares on this field and their colors. Pani must find the number of chessfields with sizes $n$ and $m$ such that the squares with the corresponding coordinates have the specified colors. Help her do it!

More formally, you are given $k$ triplets of numbers: $x_i, y_i, c_i$, where ($x_i,y_i$) --- the coordinates of the lower left edge of the square, and $c_i$ is $0$ if this square is to be is painted black, and is $1$ if this square is to be painted white. You need to print the number of different chessfields with sizes $n$ and $m$ that fit under these constraints. Two chessfields are considered different if there is at least one square painted in different colors on these planes.
## 输入格式

The first line contains four integers $n$, $m$, $k$, $g$ ($1 \leq k \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq n, m \leq 10^9$, $0 \leq g \leq 4$) --- the height of each rectangular, the width of each rectangular, the number of known squares and the number of group.

Each of the next $k$ lines contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$, $c_i$ ($1 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9, 0 \leq c_i \leq 1$) --- the coordinates and color size. Note that coordinates can be **repeated**.
## 输出格式

Print one integer --- the number of different chess planes with sizes $n$ and $m$ that fit the given constraints.

## 提示

On the left is an image of a single plane that fits the $1$ example limit.

On the right side there is one of the $8$ possible chessfields that satisfy the conditions of the example $2$.

(Blue is the coordinate axis, light gray --- squares, which should be white, dark gray --- squares, which should be black).

- ($17$ points): $1 \leq n, m, x_i, y_i, k \leq 100$;
- ($24$ points): $1 \leq n, m, k \leq 100$;
- ($31$ points): $1 \leq n \cdot m \leq 10^5, 1 \leq k \leq 10^4$;
- ($28$ points): without additional restrictions.

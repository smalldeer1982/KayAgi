Two team leaders get to assemble their teams by choosing team members among a set of players that are numbered from 1 to $N$. The leaders take turns, each picking the $k^\text{th}$ player among the remaining ones, according to their ideas of which one of the remaining players would be the best addition to their teams.

Given the choices of the two leaders (the first team leader starts first), please compute the list of players in each team.

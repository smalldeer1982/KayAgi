# [JRKSJ R1] 1+1

## 题目描述

### 玩法简介

「1+1」 是一款双人对抗游戏。两名玩家各自拥有两个数，每次一名玩家可以用自己的一个数加上对方的一个数，如果大于 $9$ 则取个位。双方轮流执行此步骤。如，下面记录了游戏的几个回合，玩家双方分别为 `a` 和 `b`：

在下面的局面解释中，第一个局面标 `*` 的是先手。

```
a:1 1*（初始局面）
b:1 2

a:1 3（1+2）
b:1 2

a:1 3
b:1 5（2+3）

a:6 3（1+5）
b:1 5
```
---

### 特殊局面

我们把下面的情况称为「攻击」：

```
3 3
5 3
6 1
9 1
```
这些攻击的「攻击度」为 $1$ ，除了 `9 1`。`9 1` 的攻击度为 $2$ 。

下面的情况称为「防御」：

```
5 1
5 5
```
这些防御的「防御度」为 $1$ ，除了 `5 5`。`5 5`的 防御度为 $2$ 。

当然，所有的攻击或防御不分两个数的顺序，如 `5 1` 和 `1 5` 都视作防御，而
 `9 1` 和 `1 9` 也都视为攻击，而攻击/防御度不变。

如果玩家 `a` 持有防御，而玩家 `b` 在下一步走成了攻击，如下面的情况：

```
a:1 5
b:1 1*

a:1 5
b:6 1
```
那么此时 `a` 持有防御度为 $1$ 的 `1 5`， `b` 持有攻击度为 $1$ 的 `6 1`，此时应该将 `a` 持有的数变成 `1 1` 而 `b` 的此次攻击无效。

也就是说，如果 `a` 的攻击的攻击度与 `b` 的防御的防御度相等，则将 `b` 的两个数变为 `1 1` 而 `a` 的此次攻击视作无效。

我们认为不属于上面的攻击/防御的攻击/防御度为 $0$ （如 `3 4` 等。）

特别的，如果遇到下面这种情况：

```
a:5 5
b:1 1*

a:5 5
b:1 6
```
`a` 的防御度为 $2$ 而 b 的攻击度为 $1$ 。此时应该把 `a` 变成 `5 1` 而 `b` 的此次攻击作废。



------------


### 胜利条件

如果一方走完一步后，他的攻击度严格大于另一方的防御度，则这一方获胜。此时不应该做任何改动，即使要把另一方变成 `1 1` 或 `5 1`。

下面给出了一个例子：

```
a:1 1
b:6 3*

a:1 1
b:6 4

a:1 5
b:6 4

a:1 5
b:6 9

a:1 1
b:6 9

a:1 1
b:6 0

a:1 7
b:6 0

a:1 7
b:6 1

（ b 胜）
```
为了消除歧义，下面再给出一些例子：

```
a:5 5
b:1 4*

a:1 1
b:1 9

a:1 0（ 1+9=10 ，个位为 0 ）
b:1 9

a:1 0
b:1 9（注意这里， b 用 1 （或 9 ）加了 a 的 0 ，这样也算一次新的攻击）

（ b 胜）
```

```
a:1 1*
b:1 4

a:1 5
b:1 4

a:1 5（因为是最后一步，无须变成“1 1”）
b:1 9（这里 b 的“1 9”直接碾压了 a 的“1 5”）

（ b 胜）
```

现在，你被要求写一个程序，作为先手通过交互的方式和 mcyl35 的程序玩这个游戏。

## 说明/提示

#### 数据规模与约定

对于测试点 $1$，保证玩家可以一步获胜。

对于测试点 $2$，保证 mcyl35 的程序随机走步。

对于其他测试点，无特殊约定。

对于 $100\%$ 的数据，$0\le p_0,p_1,c_0,c_1\le 9$。

#### 评分标准

* 有不合法的输出（如输出中含有除了 $0,1$ 之外的数），得 $0$ 分。

* 获胜或走了 $100$ 步及以上本测试点可以获得满分。

* 否则获得 $\lfloor \dfrac {st} {20} \rfloor$ 分，$st$ 表示走的步数，一步表示 mcyl35 走一步。

#### 提示

当交互库没有返回数时，说明结果已经被判定了。

#### 样例解释

```
pl:1 1*
cp:1 2

pl:2 1
cp:1 2

pl:2 1
cp:1 3

pl:5 1
cp:1 3

pl:5 1
cp:1 8

pl:6 1(胜)
cp:1 8
```

## 样例 #1

### 输入

```
1 1 1 2 0
1 1
1 0```

### 输出

```
0 0
0 1
0 0```

其实还有一个小优化就是那个 dfs 是可以记忆化的。

其他的东西 cmll02 都写了

这里说一下我是怎么优化的

首先大家的做法基本都要预处理必胜必败局面吧？

这里我开一个搜 16 层的东西在旁边跑，跑了 20s 出来了。

给一下打表程序：

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
#define write cout<<"player:\n"<<pl[0]<<' '<<pl[1]<<"\ncomputer:\n"<<cp[0]<<' '<<cp[1]<<'\n'<<'\n'
using namespace std;

int dp[10][10][10][10];
int lx(int a[2])
{
    int b[2];
    b[0]=a[0],b[1]=a[1];
    if(b[0]>b[1]) swap(b[0],b[1]);
    if(b[0]==3&&b[1]==3||b[0]==3&&b[1]==5||b[0]==1&&b[1]==6) return 1;
    if(b[0]==1&&b[1]==9) return 2;
    if(b[0]==1&&b[1]==5) return -1;
    if(b[0]==5&&b[1]==5) return -2;
    return 0;
}
int jm(int a[2],int b[2])
{
    if(lx(a)<=0) return 0;
    if(lx(a)+lx(b)>0) return 1;
    if(lx(a)==1)
    {
        if(lx(b)==-1) b[0]=b[1]=1;
        else b[0]=5,b[1]=1;
    }
    else b[0]=b[1]=1;
    return 0;
}

然后跑到了七十多 ms。

然后发现了一件神奇的事情：这题可以打表！太牛逼了！！1~~后知后觉~~

对于每个状态给出反应措施。

UPD 2021.2.16

前面对拍程序写错了，更改一下。

重新写了篇题解，现在应该是没问题了。

我们都知道 dfs。那这题我们就 dfs。

如下 `state` 表示当前局面，`inv` 表示轮到下一个人走的局面。

我们只要一直搜，如果有一种**走法**使得对面必输，那这个**局面**（注意粗体区别）就是必胜的。

否则如果一个走法不会输，那此局面就平局。

平局会永无止境地搜下去，我们设置个深度上限，达到上限直接返回平局。

这个上限在 $8$ 左右，防止 TLE。

然而这样写出来还有一些数据过不去。

问题就在这个上限剪枝，它可能剪掉了必输状态为平局……

我们需要对其优化

经过 $2h$ 的长时间对拍（多搜几层再加个记忆化），我们找到了错误的位置。但是这错得太多了啊……

于是我们想到直接把所有的必败态给处理出来。处理方法很简单，给必败态搜索并记忆化一下。必败态生成代码：（这里我搜 $8$ 层）
```cpp

    return num*f;

（如果想要检测其正确性，在[这里](https://www.luogu.com.cn/paste/7lb983qd)的代码运行后会发现并没有返回异常。）

（如果有遗漏会输出 `!!!`。）

接下来就开个数组，搜索只要两层就行了。（如果是必败态就返回 $0$）

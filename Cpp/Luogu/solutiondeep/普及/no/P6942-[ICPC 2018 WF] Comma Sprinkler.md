# [ICPC 2018 WF] Comma Sprinkler

## 题目描述

As practice will tell you, the English rules for comma placement are complex, frustrating, and often ambiguous. Many people, even the English, will, in practice, ignore them, and, apply custom rules, or, no rules, at all.

Doctor Comma Sprinkler solved this issue by developing a set of rules that sprinkles commas in a sentence with no ambiguity and little simplicity. In this problem you will help Dr. Sprinkler by producing an algorithm to automatically apply her rules.

Dr. Sprinkler's rules for adding commas to an existing piece of text are as follows:

If a word anywhere in the text is preceded by a comma, find all occurrences of that word in the text, and put a comma before each of those occurrences, except in the case where such an occurrence is the first word of a sentence or already preceded by a comma.

If a word anywhere in the text is succeeded by a comma, find all occurrences of that word in the text, and put a comma after each of those occurrences, except in the case where such an occurrence is the last word of a sentence or already succeeded by a comma.

Apply rules $1$ and $2$ repeatedly until no new commas can be added using either of them.

As an example, consider the text

please sit spot. sit spot, sit. spot here now here.

Because there is a comma after spot in the second sentence, a comma should be added after spot in the third sentence as well (but not the first sentence, since it is the last word of that sentence). Also, because there is a comma before the word sit in the second sentence, one should be added before that word in the first sentence (but no comma is added before the word sit beginning the second sentence because it is the first word of that sentence). Finally, notice that once a comma is added after spot in the third sentence, there exists a comma before the first occurrence of the word here. Therefore, a comma is also added before the other occurrence of the word here. There are no more commas to be added so the final result is

please, sit spot. sit spot, sit. spot, here now, here.

**算法分类**: 并查集

### 综合分析与结论
题目核心是通过单词前后逗号的传播规则迭代添加逗号，直到无法添加。关键在于高效处理多个单词间的依赖关系，避免重复遍历。题解主要采用并查集、图遍历（DFS/BFS）两种思路，其中并查集方法更高效。

### 精选题解

#### 1. 70CentsApple 的题解（⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐）
**关键亮点**：  
- 通过并查集合并单词的前后状态，将问题转化为集合合并问题  
- 奇偶拆分巧妙处理单词的前后逗号状态（奇数表示后逗号，偶数表示前逗号）  
- 预处理判重优化存储，最终统一标记输出  

**核心实现思想**：  
1. 将每个单词拆分为前后两种状态（奇偶编号）  
2. 合并相邻单词的前后状态（如 `单词A后逗号` 与 `单词B前逗号` 合并）  
3. 最终通过标记集合判断是否添加逗号  

```cpp
// 核心代码：并查集合并与标记处理
for (ll i=0; i<=n-1;i++) {
    if (suffix_arr[i] != '.') // 非句号则合并相邻状态
        merge(words_idx[i]*2+1, words_idx[i+1]*2);
}
for (ll i=0; i<=n-1;i++) {
    if (suffix_arr[i] == ',') // 标记初始逗号所在集合
        comma[find(words_idx[i]*2+1)] = true;
}
```

#### 2. U•ェ•*U 的题解（⭐⭐⭐⭐）
**关键亮点**：  
- 将单词前后状态建模为图节点，DFS遍历连通块  
- 双向边表示前后状态的传播逻辑  
- 通过 `vis` 数组避免重复处理  

**个人心得**：  
> "已经访问过的点可以不再访问" —— 通过标记访问状态避免无限循环，解决了规则反复应用的问题。

### 最优思路总结
**关键技巧**：  
- **状态拆分**：将每个单词的前后逗号需求拆分为独立状态（如前/后节点）  
- **依赖传播模型**：使用并查集或图结构维护状态间的依赖关系，避免多次遍历  
- **批量标记**：最终通过集合标记一次性决定所有逗号的添加位置  

**同类拓展**：  
- 依赖传播类问题（如 P1551 亲戚，并查集模板题）  
- 图遍历处理连通性（如 P1135 奇怪的电梯，BFS层级传播）

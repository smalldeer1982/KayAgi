# [CERC 2021] Cactus cutting
## 题目描述

Mr Malnar has given up on his tree obsession and found something even more interesting, cacti! Formally, a cactus is a connected graph where each edge is contained in at most one cycle. A cycle is defined as a sequence of more than one distinct edge in which every two consecutive edges share a common endpoint, and the first and last edge share a common endpoint as well.

Unfortunately, the cactus that Mr Malnar bought is rather big, so he would like to cut it up into disjoint sticks. One stick is defined as a pair of edges that share a common endpoint. Mr Malnar is a pedantic individual, so he wants to know the exact number of ways he can cut up his cactus into sticks.
## 输入格式

The first line contains the number of vertices $N$ and the number of edges $M$. This is followed by $M$ lines, each containing two distinct integers $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$ denoting an edge between vertices $A_{i}$ and $B_{i}$. Each edge will be listed exactly once.
## 输出格式

Compute the number of distinct ways Mr Malnar can cut his cactus up into sticks. Since this number can get quite large, output the result modulo $10^6 + 3$.

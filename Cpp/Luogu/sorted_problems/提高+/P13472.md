# [GCJ 2008 #3] No Cheating
## 题目描述

A local high school is going to hold a final exam in a big classroom. However, some students in this school are always trying to see each other's answer sheet during exams!

The classroom can be regarded as a rectangle of $M$ rows by $N$ columns of unit squares, where each unit square represents a seat.

The school principal decided to set the following rule to prevent cheating: Assume a student is able to see his left, right, upper-left, and upper-right neighbors' answer sheets. The assignment of seats must guarantee that nobody's answer sheet can be seen by any other student.

As in this picture, it will not be a good idea to seat anyone in A, C, D, or E because the boy in the back row would be able to see their answer sheets. However, if there is a girl sitting in B, he will not be able to see her answer sheet.

Some seats in the classroom are broken, and we cannot put a student in a broken seat.

The principal asked you to answer the following question: What is the maximum number of students that can be placed in the classroom so that no one can cheat?
## 输入格式

The first line of input gives the number of cases, $C$. $C$ test cases follow. Each case consists of two parts.

The first part is a single line with two integers $M$ and $N$: The height and width of the rectangular classroom.

The second part will be exactly $M$ lines, with exactly $N$ characters in each of these lines. Each character is either a '.' (the seat is not broken) or 'x' (the seat is broken, lowercase x).

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #$X$: $Y$", where $X$ is the case number, starting from 1, and $Y$ is the maximum possible number of students that can take the exam in the classroom.

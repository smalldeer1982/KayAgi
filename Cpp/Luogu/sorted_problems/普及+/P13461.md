# [GCJ 2008 #1B] Number Sets
## 题目描述

You start with a sequence of consecutive integers. You want to group them into sets.

You are given the interval, and an integer $P$. Initially, each number in the interval is in its own set.

Then you consider each pair of integers in the interval. If the two integers share a prime factor which is at least $P$, then you merge the two sets to which the two integers belong.

How many different sets there will be at the end of this process?
## 输入格式

One line containing an integer $C$, the number of test cases in the input file.

For each test case, there will be one line containing three single-space-separated integers $A$, $B$, and $P$. $A$ and $B$ are the first and last integers in the interval, and $P$ is the number as described above.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing the string "Case #$X$: $Y$" where $X$ is the number of the test case, starting from 1, and $Y$ is the number of sets.
## 样例

### 样例输入 #1
```
2
10 20 5
10 20 3
```
### 样例输出 #1

Case #1: 9
Case #2: 7
```
## 提示

**Small dataset (10 Pts, Test set 1 - Visible)**

- $1 \leq C \leq 10$
- $1 \leq A \leq B \leq 1000$
- $2 \leq P \leq B$

**Large dataset (25 Pts, Test set 2 - Hidden)**

- $1 \leq C \leq 100$
- $1 \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{12}$
- $B \leq A + 1000000$
- $2 \leq P \leq B$

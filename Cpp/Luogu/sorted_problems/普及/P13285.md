# [GCJ 2013 #1A] Bullseye
## 题目描述

Maria has been hired by the Ghastly Chemicals Junkies (GCJ) company to help them manufacture **bullseyes**. A **bullseye** consists of a number of concentric rings (rings that are centered at the same point), and it usually represents an archery target. GCJ is interested in manufacturing black-and-white bullseyes.

Maria starts with $t$ millilitres of black paint, which she will use to draw rings of thickness $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ (one centimetre). A ring of thickness $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ is the space between two concentric circles whose radii differ by $1 \mathrm{~cm}$.

Maria draws the first black ring around a white circle of radius $r \mathrm{~cm}$. Then she repeats the following process for as long as she has enough paint to do so:

1. Maria imagines a white ring of thickness $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ around the last black ring.
2. Then she draws a new black ring of thickness $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ around that white ring.

Note that each "white ring" is simply the space between two black rings.

The area of a disk with radius $1 \mathrm{~cm}$ is $\pi \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. One millilitre of paint is required to cover area $\pi \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. What is the maximum number of black rings that Maria can draw? Please note that:

* Maria only draws complete rings. If the remaining paint is not enough to draw a complete black ring, she stops painting immediately.
* There will always be enough paint to draw at least one black ring.
## 输入格式

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow. Each test case consists of a line containing two space separated integers: $r$ and $t$.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: $y$", where $x$ is the case number (starting from $1$) and $y$ is the maximum number of black rings that Maria can draw.

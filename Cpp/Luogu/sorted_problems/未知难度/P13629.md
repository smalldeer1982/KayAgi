# [NWRRC 2021] Boris and Berta
## 题目描述

Boris is making a quest for his sister Berta. One of the tasks is to find a point on the map that is $n$ meters to the north from their house. But it's too easy if $n$ is specified directly. Boris decided to use miles and cables to specify the distance.

He found out that there are a lot of different miles: from a $500$-meter Chinese mile (called $\textit{li}$) up to a $11\,299$-meter Norwegian mile (called $\textit{mil}$). And a cable length can be anywhere from $169$ to $220$ meters.

Boris decided to use an $m$-meter mile and a $c$-meter cable. Now he wants to represent the $n$-meter distance as "$M$ miles and $C$ cables" with non-negative integers $M$ and $C$ as precisely as possible --- that is, he wants to minimize $|M\cdot m+C\cdot c-n|$. Help him!
## 输入格式

Three lines contain an integer each: $n$ --- the distance to represent, $m$ --- the chosen length of a mile, and $c$ --- the chosen length of a cable ($1 \le n \le 10^9$; $500 \le m \le 11\,299$; $169 \le c \le 220$). All values are given in meters.
## 输出格式

Print two non-negative integers $M$ and $C$ --- the best approximation for the distance of $n$ meters using the chosen mile and cable lengths. If there are multiple best approximations, print any of them.

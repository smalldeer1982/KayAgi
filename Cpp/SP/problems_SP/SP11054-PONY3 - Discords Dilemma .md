# PONY3 - Discords Dilemma 

## 题目描述

Discord is in trouble for causing discord, so he is trying to escape from Equestria. He's arrived at the port, and he doesn't care what boat he gets on, he just wants to get out. He can see the boat schedule, where he sees that N boats are arriving today,

boat 1 arrives any time within a\_1 minutes

boat 2 arrives any time within a\_2 minutes

...

boat N arrives any time within a\_N minutes (uniform distribution)

Tell discord the expected number of minutes he needs to wait for a boat to arrive.

For some reason, you should be accurate to 10^-6 of a minute.

# TEAM2 - A Famous ICPC Team

## 题目描述

Mr. B, Mr. G, Mr. M and their coach Professor S are planning their way to Warsaw for the ACM-ICPC World Finals. Each of the four has a square-shaped suitcase with side length A $ _{i} $ (1 <= _i_ <= 4) respectively. They want to pack their suitcases into a large square box. The heights of the large box as well as the four suitcases are exactly the same. So they only need to consider the large box’s side length. Of course, you should write a program to output the minimum side length of the large box so that the four suitcases can be put into the box without overlapping.

## 输入格式

Each test case contains only one line containing 4 integers A $ _{i} $ (1<= _i_ <=4, 1<= A $ _{i} $ <=1,000,000,000) indicating the side length of each suitcase.

## 输出格式

For each test case, display a single line containing the case number and the minimum side length of the large box required.

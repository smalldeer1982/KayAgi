# PTIME - Prime Time

## 题目描述

  For your math homework this week your teacher gave you five large numbers and asked you to find their prime factors. However these numbers aren't _nearly_ large enough for someone with knowledge of programming like yourself. So you decide to take the factorial of each of these numbers. Recall that N! (N factorial) is the product of the integers from 1 through N (inclusive). It’s your job now to create a program to help you do your homework.

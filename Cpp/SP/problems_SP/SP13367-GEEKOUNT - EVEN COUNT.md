## 题目描述

**Problem Statement:**

Let f(x) be the product of digits of a number.

Given L and R, find the number of values of 'i' such that L <= i <= R and f(i) is [even](http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number).

**Input:**

The first line consists of an integer t, the number of test cases. For each test case, you are given the two integers L and R.

**Output:**

For each test case, print the number of values of 'i' such that L <= i <= R and f(i) is even.

**Input Constraints:**

1 <= t <= 100

1 <= L <= R <= 1000000000

**Sample Input:**

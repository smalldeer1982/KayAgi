# FACTMULO - Product of factorials (again)

## 题目描述

For **_n_** positive integer, let **_F(n) = 1! × 2! × 3! × 4! × ... × n!_**, product of factorial(i) for i in \[1..n\], For **_p_** a prime number, and **_n_** an integer, and let **_V(p, n) = max({i>=0 integer, such that p^i divides F(n)})_**.

## 输入格式

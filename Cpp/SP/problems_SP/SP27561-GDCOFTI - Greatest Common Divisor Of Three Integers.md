# GDCOFTI - Greatest Common Divisor Of Three Integers

## 题目描述

It is said that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two or more whole integers, is the largest integer that divides them without leaving residue. Euclid's algorithm is famous for allowing to find the GCD between two integers. This challenge asks you, you find the GCD between three integers.

**Challenge**

The entry consists of 3 whole nonnegative integers (< 2 $ ^{64} $ ), one per line and the output will be the GCD of the 3 integers.

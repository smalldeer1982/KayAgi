# ADACYCLE - Ada and Cycle

## 题目描述

Ada the Ladybug is on a trip in Bugindia. There are many cities and some uni-directional roads connecting them. Ada is wondering about the shortest path, which begins in a city and ends in the same city. Since Ada likes short trips, she asked you to find the length of such path for each city in Bugindia.

## 输入格式

The first line will contain **0 < N , the number of cities.**

Then **N** lines follow, each containing **N** integers  **0 . One means, that there is a road between  **i**  and  **j**  (zero means there isn't a road).**

## 输出格式

Print **N** lines, the length of shortest path which begins in city **i** and ends in city **i**. If the path doesn't exist, print "**NO WAY**" instead.

# ACS - A concrete simulation

## 题目描述

You are given a matrix M of type 1234x5678. It is initially filled with integers 1...1234x5678 in row major order. Your task is to process a list of commands manipulating M. There are 4 types of commands:   
 "R x y" swap the x-th and y-th row of M ;  
 "C x y" swap the x-th and y-th column of M ;  
 "Q x y" write out M(x,y) ;  
 "W z" write out x and y where z=M(x,y).

## 输入格式

A list of valid commands. Input terminated by EOF.

## 输出格式

For each "Q x y" write out one line with the current value of M(x,y), for each "W z" write out one line with the value of x and y ( interpreted as above ) separated by a space.

 ```
Input:
R 1 2
Q 1 1
Q 2 1
W 1
W 5679
C 1 2
Q 1 1
Q 2 1
W 1
W 5679

Output:
5679
1
2 1
1 1
5680
2
2 2
1 2
```

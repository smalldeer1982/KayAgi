# SQFREE - Square-free integers

## 题目描述

In number theory we call an integer square-free if it is not divisible by a perfect square, except 1. You have to count them!

## 输入格式

First line contains an integer _T_, the number of test cases (_T_≤100). The following T lines each contains one positive integer: _n_, where n ≤ 10 $ ^{14} $

## 输出格式

_T_ lines, on each line output the number of (positive) square-free integers not larger than n.

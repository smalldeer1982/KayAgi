# TRANSP2 - Transposing is Even More Fun

## 输入格式

 First line of input contains number of test cases c (1<=c<=400000). Each test case consists of two integers a,b (0<=a+b<=1000000).

## 输出格式

 For each test case output minimal number of swaps required to transpose an 2ax2b array. As it can be quite large, you have to output its remainder when divided by 1000003 (yes, it's a prime number :).

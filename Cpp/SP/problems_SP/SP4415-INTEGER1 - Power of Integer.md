# INTEGER1 - Power of Integer

## 题目描述

For a given positive integer _y_(_y_ > 1), if we can find a largest integer k and a smallest positive integer _x_, such that _x^k=y_, then the power of _y_ is regarded as _k_.

Calculate the sum of the power of the integers from a to b. (2<= _a_ <= _b_ <=10 $ ^{18} $ )

## 输入格式

The input consists of multiple test cases.

For each test case, there is one line containing two integers _a_ and _b_.

End of input is indicated by a line containing two zeros.

## 输出格式

For each test case, output the sum of the power of the integers from _a_ to _b_.

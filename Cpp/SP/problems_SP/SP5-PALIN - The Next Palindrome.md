# PALIN - The Next Palindrome

## 题目描述

A positive integer is called a _palindrome_ if its representation in the decimal system is the same when read from left to right and from right to left. For a given positive integer _K_ of not more than 1000000 digits, write the value of the smallest palindrome larger than _K_ to output. Numbers are always displayed without leading zeros.

## 输入格式

The first line contains integer _t_, the number of test cases. Integers _K_ are given in the next _t_ lines.

## 输出格式

For each _K_, output the smallest palindrome larger than _K_.

# BORW - Black or White

## 题目描述

“_It’s Black, It’s White, It’s Tough For You To Get By_”  
Michael Jackson (1958-2009)

  
You have a sequence of integers. You can paint each of the integers black or white, or leave  
it unpainted. The black integers must appear in ascending order and the white integers  
must appear in descending order. The ascending/descending order must be strict, that  
is, two integers painted with the same color cannot be equal. Paint the sequence so as to  
minimize the number of unpainted integers.

## 输入格式

The input contains several test cases, each one described in exactly two lines. The first line  
contains an integer N indicating the number of elements in the sequence (1 The second line contains N integers Xi separated by single spaces, representing the  
sequence to paint (1 single −1 and should not be processed as a test case.

## 输出格式

For each test case output a single line with an integer representing the minimum number  
of unpainted elements of the sequence, when the sequence is painted optimally following  
the rules described above.

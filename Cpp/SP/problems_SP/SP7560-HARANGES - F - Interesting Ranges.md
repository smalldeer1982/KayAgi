# HARANGES - F - Interesting Ranges

## 题目描述

**Interesting Ranges**

A positive integer is a _palindrome_ if its decimal representation (without leading zeros) is a palindromic string (a string that reads the same forwards and backwards). For example, the numbers 5, 77, 363, 4884, 11111, 12121 and 349943 are palindromes.

A range of integers is _interesting_ if it contains an even number of palindromes. The range \[L, R\], with L

The range \[L $ _{1} $ ,R $ _{1} $ \] is a _subrange_ of \[L,R\] if L

Input

The first line of input gives the number of test cases, **T**. **T** test cases follow. Each test case is a single line containing two positive integers, **L** and **R** (in that order), separated by a space.

Output

For each test case, output one line. That line should contain "Case #x: y", where x is the case number starting with 1, and y is the number of interesting subranges of \[L,R\], modulo 1000000007.

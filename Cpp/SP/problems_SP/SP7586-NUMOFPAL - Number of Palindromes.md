# NUMOFPAL - Number of Palindromes

## 题目描述

Each palindrome can be always created from the other palindromes, if a single character is also a palindrome. For example, the string "malayalam" can be created by some ways:

  
\* malayalam = m + ala + y + ala + m  
\* malayalam = m + a + l + aya + l + a + m  
  
We want to take the value of function NumPal(s) which is the number of different palindromes that can be created using the string S by the above method. If the same palindrome occurs more than once then all of them should be counted separately.

## 输入格式

The string S.

## 输出格式

The value of function NumPal(s).

## 说明/提示

**Limitations**

0 < |s| <= 1000

## 样例 #1

### 输入

```
malayalam
```

### 输出

```
15
```

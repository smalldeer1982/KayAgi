# SEQ7 - Yet Another Sequence Problem

## 题目描述

We have an infinite non-decreasing sequence A which is created as follows :

- A\[1\] = 1 and A\[2\] = 2.
- A number i occurs A\[i\] times in the sequence.

First few terms in the sequence are: { 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7... }. Note that 3 occurs 2 times in the sequence, (because A\[3\] = 2).

Your task is to find the term A\[n\] for any given n, where 0 < n <= 1e13.

### Input

First line contains t, the number of testcases. Each of the next t lines contains a number n.

### Output

For every case, print the nth term of the sequence.

### Example

**Input:**  
2  
5  
12

**Output:**  
3  
6

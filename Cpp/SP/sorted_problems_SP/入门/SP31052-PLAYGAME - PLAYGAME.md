# PLAYGAME - PLAYGAME

## 题目描述

 Hemlata and Ragini were playing a game from a number of coins. Hemlata was jealous of Ragini. She wanted to win at all cost. A stack consists of **n** coins. Any player can take either 1, 2 or 5 (anyone number of coins) coins from stack at a time. Both Hemlata and Ragini play their moves alternatively.

 Hemlata always starts first. Both play optimally. Your job is to predict the output beforehand. A player who can't take any coin loses the game. A player can take only one of 1, 2, 5 number of coins at a time in a move.

## 输入格式

First line contains number of testcases **t**. 0 < **t** <= 10^5

An integer **n** denoting number of coins. 0 <= **n** <= 10^18

## 输出格式

# PGCD - Primes in GCD Table

## 题目描述

Johnny has created a table which encodes the results of some operation -- a function of two arguments. But instead of a boring multiplication table of the sort you learn by heart at prep-school, he has created a GCD (greatest common divisor) table! So he now has a table (of height a and width b), indexed from (1,1) to (a,b), and with the value of field (i,j) equal to gcd(i,j). He wants to know how many times he has used prime numbers when writing the table.

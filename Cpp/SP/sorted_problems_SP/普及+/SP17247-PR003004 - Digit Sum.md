# PR003004 - Digit Sum

## 题目描述

For a pair of integers a and b, the digit sum of the interval \[a,b\] is defined as the sum of all digits occurring in all numbers between (and including) a and b. For example, the digit sum of \[28, 31\] can be calculated as:

## 输入格式

## 输出格式

Per test case:

- one line with an integer: the digit sum of \[a,b\];

# ULM02 - The Sierpinski Fractal

## 题目描述

Consider a regular triangular area, divide it into four equal triangles of half height and remove the one in the middle. Apply the same operation recursively to each of the three remaining triangles. If we repeated this procedure infinite times, we'd obtain something with an area of zero. The fractal that evolves this way is called the Sierpinski Triangle. Although its topological dimension is _2_, its Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension is_log(3)/log(2)~1.58_, a fractional value (that's why it is called a fractal). By the way, the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension of the Norwegian coast is approximately _1.52_, its topological dimension being _1_.

For this problem, you are to outline the Sierpinski Triangle up to a certain recursion depth, using just ASCII characters. Since the drawing resolution is thus fixed, you'll need to grow the picture appropriately. Draw the smallest triangle (that is not divided any further) with two slashes, to backslashes and two underscores like this:

# PRIME1 - Prime Generator

## 题目描述

 Peter wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him! Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers!

## 输入格式

 The input begins with the number t of test cases in a single line (t<=10). In each of the next t lines there are two numbers m and n (1 <= m <= n <= 1000000000, n-m<=100000) separated by a space.

## 输出格式

For every test case print all prime numbers p such that m <= p <= n, one number per line, test cases separated by an empty line.

## 说明/提示

**Warning: large Input/Output data, be careful with certain languages (though most should be OK if the algorithm is well designed)**

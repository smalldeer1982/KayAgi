# GLJIVE - GLJIVE

## 题目描述

 In front of Super Mario there are **10 mushrooms**, arranged in a row. A certain amount of points is awarded for picking each of the mushrooms. Super Mario must pick mushrooms **in order** they appear, but is not required to pick them all – his goal is to score a number of points **as close as possible to 100**.

In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close to 100 (e.g. 98 and 102), Mario will pick the **greater** one (in this case 102).

Help Super Mario and tell him how many points he will score.

## 输入格式

Input consists of 10 lines, each of which contains one positive integer less than or equal to 100, denoting the scores awarded for picking each mushroom, in the order that Mario can pick them in.

## 输出格式

The first and only line of output must contain the required number of points.

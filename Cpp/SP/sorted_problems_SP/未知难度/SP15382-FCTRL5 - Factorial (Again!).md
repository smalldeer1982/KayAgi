In this problem you need to do the same task (given positive integer **n** < 10 $ ^{100} $ you need to count number of zeroes at the end of the decimal number of **n!**), seems easy(?) but this time only Brainf\*\*k language allowed.

## 输入格式

First line of input there is an integer **T**

Next **T** lines containing an integer **n**.

Each line is terminated with newline character (ASCII:10)

## 输出格式

For each test case, output number of zeroes at the end of the decimal form of number **n!**

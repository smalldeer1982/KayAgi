# IITKWPCF - Help Feluda with mathematical equations

## 题目描述

 Feluda likes numbers very much but hates prime numbers too much. For a fixed n, you gave Feluda eqution x^2 + y^2 + n = (x + y) ^ 2. Now you only want positive integral solution of x and y. Feluda being an intelligent person gave you all the pairs of (x, y) but he missed the pairs which had x as a prime number.

 For all the solution that Feluda gave you, we want you to just print those values in the following format: first print the number of such x's, then the possible values x sorted in increasing order in a line seperated by single space. If no such numbers exist, then print a 0 in the line.

## 输入格式

T : number of test cases (T <= 100)  
For next T lines each line contain n (n <= 10^12)

## 输出格式

For every test case print as stated in the problem statement.

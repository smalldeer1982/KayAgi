# TAP2014C - Constellation of the parallelogram

## 题目描述

**\[The original version of this problem (in Spanish) can be found at [http://dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/tap2014-problems.pdf](http://dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/tap2014-problems.pdf "http://dc.uba.ar/events/icpc/download/problems/tap2014-problems.pdf") \]**

One morning, when Cyrus Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself lying on his bed, but not transformed into a monstrous insect. However, when he looked at the still starry sky, he found that the visual setting of cosmos showed four stars positioned as the vertices of a perfect parallelogram. Being a big geometry enthusiast, he called those four stars "constellation of the parallelogram".

## 输入格式

The first line contains an integer **N** indicating the number of stars on the image to be analyzed (**4  ****1000**).****

The following **N** lines describe each of the stars on the image with two integers **X $ _{i} $**  and **Y $ _{i} $** , indicating respectively the **X** and **Y** coordinates of the star on the Cartesian plane (**-10 $ ^{8} $**  ****X $ _{i} $ , Y $ _{i} $**  ****10 $ ^{8} $**  for **i = 1, 2, ..., N**). You may assume that no two stars on the image are on the same position.****

## 输出格式

Print a single line containing a single integer representing the number of sets of four points on the input image that are the vertices of a parallelogram.

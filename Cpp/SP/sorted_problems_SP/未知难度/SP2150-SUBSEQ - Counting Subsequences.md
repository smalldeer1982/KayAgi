# SUBSEQ - Counting Subsequences

## 题目描述

**"47 is the quintessential random number,"** states the 47 society. And there might be a grain of truth in that.

For example, the first ten digits of the Euler's constant are:

 ```

2 7 1 8 2 8 1 8 2 8
```
And what's their sum? Of course, it is 47.

Try walking around with your eyes open. You may be sure that soon you will start discovering occurences of the number 47 everywhere.

# PALNUM - Palindromic Number

## 题目描述

A postive integer A is called a "palindrome number" if the reverse of the decimal representaion is the same as the original one. Ex. 13231 is a palindrome number, but 13333 is not.   
  
 Given a number A(1 <= A <= 1e18), find the number of pairs (a,b) such that a,b are both palindrome numbers, and the sum of a and b is A.   
  
 If A is 391, there are 6 ways: 8 + 383 = 383 + 8 = 391 88 + 303 = 303 + 88 = 391 99 + 292 = 292 + 99 = 391

## 输入格式

The first Line contains the number of test cases T <= 10. Each test case contains a number A.

## 输出格式

Output the number of ways.

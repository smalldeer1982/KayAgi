# TPGA - The Permutation Game Again

## 题目描述

Since YoMamaSoFat was able to answer Blackhood's and Kira's question as in http://www.spoj.com/problems/TPGAME/ (though with a little help from your side), it was my turn to ask him a question. This would again be a coding question as you might be knowing he is a noob in coding. I gave him a permutation of N distinct integers from 1...N and asked him the rank of the permutation when all possible permutations of the integers are arranged lexicographically. eg for N=3, all possible permutations arranged lexicographically would be:-  
  
1 2 3  
  
1 3 2  
  
2 1 3  
  
2 3 1  
  
3 1 2  
  
3 2 1  
  
From the above, rank of 1 2 3 would be 1, rank of 1 3 2 would be 2 and so on...  
  
**HELP HIM!**  
  
**NOTE:- You may assume it is the same permutation which Blackhood gave him in http://www.spoj.com/problems/TPGAME/ to tell the no. of inversions for each integer in it.![Wink](../../../gfx/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-wink.gif "Wink")**

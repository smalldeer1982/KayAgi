# CS - Another Longest Common Subsequence Problem

## 题目描述

Given a non-negative integer **X**. Calculate the smallest non-negative integer **Y**, such that **Y** <= **X**, and the length of the longest common subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of **string(Y)** and **string(X-Y)** is maximum possible, where **string(T)** denotes the decimal notation of number **T** without any leading zeroes.

## 输入格式

Multiple test cases. Each test case contains one line with one integer **X** (0 <= **X** <= 10 $ ^{16} $ ).

## 输出格式

For each test case output one line with one integer **Y**.

# DIV15 - Divisibility by 15

## 题目描述

There is a string containing only decimal digit characters. The length of the string is between _1_ and _1000_. Using characters of the string, you have to construct the maximum number which divides by fifteen without remainder. Each character of the string may not be used more than once.

## 输入格式

First line of input contains an integer **t** (_1_ ≤ **t** ≤ _90_), equal to the number of testcases. Then descriptions of **t** testcases follow.

Each testcase is described in a single line representing the source string.

## 输出格式

For each testcase output one line with the decimal representation of the maximum number. Leading zeroes should be omitted. If no number can be constructed, output a single word _“impossible”_.

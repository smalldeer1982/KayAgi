# VLATTICE - Visible Lattice Points

## 题目描述

Consider a N\*N\*N lattice. One corner is at (0,0,0) and the opposite one is at (N,N,N). How many lattice points are visible from corner at (0,0,0) ? A point X is visible from point Y iff no other lattice point lies on the segment joining X and Y.   
   
Input :   
The first line contains the number of test cases T. The next T lines contain an interger N   
   
Output :   
Output T lines, one corresponding to each test case.

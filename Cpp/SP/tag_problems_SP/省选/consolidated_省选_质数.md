# SUMPRIM2 - Sum of primes (reverse mode)

## 题目描述

XerK had prepared his new problem with some sums of primes up to some bounds. His results are well here, but he forgot the bounds. Your task is to find which was the last prime in the sum. This problem is extremely simple, but you have to be extremely fast.

## 输入格式

The lonely line of input contains an integer **_S_**.

## 输出格式

You have to print the last prime **_P_** such that **_sum(prime from 2 to P) = S_**.

# PRIMES2 - Printing some primes (Hard)

## 题目描述

The problem statement is really simple (the constraints maybe not). You are to write all primes less than 10^9.

## 输入格式

There is not input.

## 输出格式

To make the problem less output related write out only the 1st, 501st, 1001st, ... 1st mod 500.

## 样例 #1
